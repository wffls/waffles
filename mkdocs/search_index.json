            "text": "Waffles from Scratch\n\n\nTo illustrate Waffles's design, I'll walk through the creation of a Bash script that can successfully run multiple times on a single server and only make changes to the server when required.\n\n\nLet's Create a Simple memcached Server in Bash\n\n\nmemcached\n is a very simple service. It's a single daemon with a simple configuration file installed from a single package.\n\n\nLet's say we want to create a \nmemcached\n server on a Linux container or virtual machine. Rather than running the commands manually, we'll create a Bash script to do the work. This will serve two purposes:\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nRepeatable process\n\n\n\n\nThe First Draft\n\n\nThe initial Bash script would look something like:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\napt-get install -y memcached\n\n\n\n\nThe Second Draft\n\n\nThis works, and doing \nps aux\n shows that \nmemcached\n is indeed running. But then we notice that \nmemcached\n is only listening on \nlocalhost\n:\n\n\n$ netstat -nap | grep 11211\n\n\n\n\nSince this \nmemcached\n service will be used by other services on the network, we need to change \nmemcached\n's interface binding to \n0.0.0.0\n. The following should work:\n\n\n$ sed -i -e '/^-l 127.0.0.1$/c -l 0.0.0.0' /etc/memcached.conf\n$ /etc/init.d/memcached restart\n\n\n\n\nAnd once that's tested on the command line, we add it to our script:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\napt-get install -y memcached\nsed -i -e '/^-l 127.0.0.1$/c -l 0.0.0.0' /etc/memcached.conf\n/etc/init.d/memcached restart\n\n\n\n\nAstute readers will see an issue. In order for us to test this script, we need to run it again. However, the script is going to report that \nmemcached\n is already installed and an unnecessary restart of \nmemcached\n will take place.\n\n\nThere are two ways to resolve this issue:\n\n\nThe first is by starting over from scratch and running the script on a new server. There's a lot of merit to this method. For example, you can be sure that the exact steps work in sequence on new servers. However, the entire process could take a long time for some situations. Also, what if this \nmemcached\n service was in production? Either you'd have to take the \nmemcached\n service down temporarily while the new service builds or you'd have to find some way of seamlessly adding in the new service while removing the old. While there's benefit to this (which is similar to the current popularity of \"microservices\"), it may not always be a possible solution.\n\n\nThe second way is to alter the script so that changes are only made if required. If a change does not need to be made, nothing happens.\n\n\nLet's say it's not possible for us to rebuild from scratch. Therefore, we'll opt for the second option.\n\n\nThe Third Draft\n\n\nIn order to run our Bash script against a running service without causing (too much of) a disruption, we must ensure that each step is executed only if it needs to be. This means that before any command has run, we must check to see what the current state of the system is, compare it to the change we want to make, and only make the change if the system state does not match.\n\n\nBy doing this, our Bash script becomes a \"state declaration\" that describes how the \nmemcached\n service should be configured when the script is done running. This is known as \nIdempotence\n in Configuration Management.\n\n\nSo let's make our basic Bash script more idempotent:\n\n\ndpkg -s memcached \n/dev/null\nif [ $? == 1 ]; then\n  echo \nInstalling memcached\n\n  apt-get install -y memcached\nfi\n\ngrep -q '^-l 127.0.0.1' /etc/memcached.conf\nif [ $? == 0 ]; then\n  echo \nUpdating memcached.conf and restarting it.\n\n  sed -i -e '/^-l 127.0.0.1$/c -l 0.0.0.0' /etc/memcached.conf\n  /etc/init.d/memcached restart\nfi\n\n\n\n\nWith this in place, we can now execute this script multiple times on the same server, virtual machine, or container, and if a step has already been done it will not happen again.\n\n\nThe Fourth Draft\n\n\nHaving to do a bunch of \ngrep\ns and other checks can become very tedious. Waffles tries to resolve this by including a Standard Library of common tasks. Using the Waffles Standard Library, the above script can be re-written as:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsource ./waffles.conf\nsource ./lib/init.sh\n\nstdlib.apt --package memcached\nstdlib.file_line --name memcached.conf/listen --file /etc/memcached.conf --line \n-l 0.0.0.0\n --match \n^-l\n\nstdlib.sysvinit --name memcached\n\nif [ \n$stdlib_state_change\n == true ]; then\n  /etc/init.d/memcached restart\nfi\n\n\n\n\nThere's nothing magical about these commands. They're a collection of standard Bash functions that sweep all of the messy \ngrep\ns under the carpet. You can see the full collection of Standard Library functions in the \nlib/\n directory.\n\n\nThe Fifth Draft\n\n\nThe core \nmemcached\n service is up and running, but there's still a few more tasks that need to be done. For example, maybe we want to create some users:\n\n\nstdlib.groupadd --group jdoe --gid 999\nstdlib.useradd --user jdoe --uid 999 --gid 999 --comment \nJohn\n --shell /bin/bash --homedir /home/jdoe --createhome true\n\n\n\n\nstdlib.useradd\n is another Waffles Standard Library function that enables an easy way to create and manage a user on a server.\n\n\nLooking at the above command, there are a lot of settings that are hard-coded. If we end up creating a \nredis\n server that also needs the \njdoe\n user, we could just copy that line verbatim, but what about a scenario where the \nuid\n must be changed to \n500\n? Then we'd need to change every occurrence of \n999\n to \n500\n. In large environments, there's a chance some changes would be missed.\n\n\nTo resolve this issue, Waffles allows settings such as this (known as \ndata\n) to be stored in data files.\n\n\nA simple way of using data is to just throw all settings into a file called \nsite/data/common.sh\n.\n\n\nLet's add a user:\n\n\ndata_users=(\n  jdoe\n)\n\ndeclare -Ag data_user_info\ndata_user_info=(\n  [jdoe|uid]=999\n  [jdoe|gid]=999\n  [jdoe|comment]=\nJohn doe\n\n  [jdoe|homedir]=\n/home/jdoe\n\n  [jdoe|shell]=\n/bin/bash\n\n  [jdoe|create_home]=true\n)\n\n\n\n\nWaffles data variables can be named anything, but if you want to follow the project standards, have the variables start with \ndata_\n.\n\n\nWith all of this in place, the fifth draft now looks like:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsource ./waffles.conf\nsource ./lib/init.sh\n\nstdlib.data common\n\nfor user in \n${data_users[@]}\n; do\n\n  homedir=\n${data_user_info[${user}|homedir]}\n\n  uid=\n${data_user_info[${user}|uid]}\n\n  gid=\n${data_user_info[${user}|gid]}\n\n  comment=\n${data_user_info[${user}|comment]}\n\n  shell=\n${data_user_info[${user}|shell]}\n\n  create_home=\n${data_user_info[${user}|create_home]}\n\n\n  stdlib.groupadd --group \n$user\n --gid \n$gid\n\n  stdlib.useradd --state present --user \n$user\n --uid \n$uid\n --gid \n$gid\n --comment \n$comment\n --homedir \n$homedir\n --shell \n$shell\n --createhome \n$createhome\n\n\ndone\n\nstdlib.apt --package memcached\nstdlib.file_line --name memcached.conf/listen --file /etc/memcached.conf --line \n-l 0.0.0.0\n --match \n^-l\n\nstdlib.sysvinit --name memcached\n\nif [ \n$stdlib_state_change\n == true ]; then\n  /etc/init.d/memcached restart\nfi\n\n\n\n\nThe Sixth Draft\n\n\nThe block of user data can be re-used in other scripts. It'd be best if we just moved it out into its own separate script. By repeating this process, we can create a library of re-usable components. Final scripts then become \"compositions\" of the collection of scripts.\n\n\nCreate the directory structure \nsite/profiles/common/scripts\n and add the following to \nsite/profiles/common/scripts/users.sh\n\n\nfor user in \n${data_users[@]}\n; do\n\n  homedir=\n${data_user_info[${user}|homedir]}\n\n  uid=\n${data_user_info[${user}|uid]}\n\n  gid=\n${data_user_info[${user}|gid]}\n\n  comment=\n${data_user_info[${user}|comment]}\n\n  shell=\n${data_user_info[${user}|shell]}\n\n  create_home=\n${data_user_info[${user}|create_home]}\n\n\n  stdlib.groupadd --group \n$user\n --gid \n$gid\n\n  stdlib.useradd --state present --user \n$user\n --uid \n$uid\n --gid \n$gid\n --comment \n$comment\n --homedir \n$homedir\n --shell \n$shell\n --createhome \n$createhome\n\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\nAnd so the sixth draft now looks like:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsource ./waffles.conf\nsource ./lib/init.sh\n\nstdlib.data common\nstdlib.profile common/users\n\nstdlib.apt --package memcached\nstdlib.file_line --name memcached.conf/listen --file /etc/memcached.conf --line \n-l 0.0.0.0\n --match \n^-l\n\nstdlib.sysvinit --name memcached\n\nif [ \n$stdlib_state_change\n == true ]; then\n  /etc/init.d/memcached restart\nfi\n\n\n\n\nYou can create this script inside the Waffles directory (where \nwaffles.conf\n is located), and run it like so:\n\n\nbash test.sh\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run it for the first time on a new server, it'll add the group, user, and set up \nmemcached\n. Run it multiple times and note how those same actions were not performed since the script detected that no changes needed to be made.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nAt this point, we've effectively recreated the core of Waffles. The rest of controls how Waffles runs and where to find various files that Waffles needs to read.",

            "text": "memcached  is a very simple service. It's a single daemon with a simple configuration file installed from a single package.  Let's say we want to create a  memcached  server on a Linux container or virtual machine. Rather than running the commands manually, we'll create a Bash script to do the work. This will serve two purposes:   Documentation  Repeatable process   The First Draft  The initial Bash script would look something like:  #!/bin/bash\n\napt-get install -y memcached  The Second Draft  This works, and doing  ps aux  shows that  memcached  is indeed running. But then we notice that  memcached  is only listening on  localhost :  $ netstat -nap | grep 11211  Since this  memcached  service will be used by other services on the network, we need to change  memcached 's interface binding to  0.0.0.0 . The following should work:  $ sed -i -e '/^-l 127.0.0.1$/c -l 0.0.0.0' /etc/memcached.conf\n$ /etc/init.d/memcached restart  And once that's tested on the command line, we add it to our script:  #!/bin/bash\n\napt-get install -y memcached\nsed -i -e '/^-l 127.0.0.1$/c -l 0.0.0.0' /etc/memcached.conf\n/etc/init.d/memcached restart  Astute readers will see an issue. In order for us to test this script, we need to run it again. However, the script is going to report that  memcached  is already installed and an unnecessary restart of  memcached  will take place.  There are two ways to resolve this issue:  The first is by starting over from scratch and running the script on a new server. There's a lot of merit to this method. For example, you can be sure that the exact steps work in sequence on new servers. However, the entire process could take a long time for some situations. Also, what if this  memcached  service was in production? Either you'd have to take the  memcached  service down temporarily while the new service builds or you'd have to find some way of seamlessly adding in the new service while removing the old. While there's benefit to this (which is similar to the current popularity of \"microservices\"), it may not always be a possible solution.  The second way is to alter the script so that changes are only made if required. If a change does not need to be made, nothing happens.  Let's say it's not possible for us to rebuild from scratch. Therefore, we'll opt for the second option.  The Third Draft  In order to run our Bash script against a running service without causing (too much of) a disruption, we must ensure that each step is executed only if it needs to be. This means that before any command has run, we must check to see what the current state of the system is, compare it to the change we want to make, and only make the change if the system state does not match.  By doing this, our Bash script becomes a \"state declaration\" that describes how the  memcached  service should be configured when the script is done running. This is known as  Idempotence  in Configuration Management.  So let's make our basic Bash script more idempotent:  dpkg -s memcached  /dev/null\nif [ $? == 1 ]; then\n  echo  Installing memcached \n  apt-get install -y memcached\nfi\n\ngrep -q '^-l 127.0.0.1' /etc/memcached.conf\nif [ $? == 0 ]; then\n  echo  Updating memcached.conf and restarting it. \n  sed -i -e '/^-l 127.0.0.1$/c -l 0.0.0.0' /etc/memcached.conf\n  /etc/init.d/memcached restart\nfi  With this in place, we can now execute this script multiple times on the same server, virtual machine, or container, and if a step has already been done it will not happen again.  The Fourth Draft  Having to do a bunch of  grep s and other checks can become very tedious. Waffles tries to resolve this by including a Standard Library of common tasks. Using the Waffles Standard Library, the above script can be re-written as:  #!/bin/bash\n\nsource ./waffles.conf\nsource ./lib/init.sh\n\nstdlib.apt --package memcached\nstdlib.file_line --name memcached.conf/listen --file /etc/memcached.conf --line  -l 0.0.0.0  --match  ^-l \nstdlib.sysvinit --name memcached\n\nif [  $stdlib_state_change  == true ]; then\n  /etc/init.d/memcached restart\nfi  There's nothing magical about these commands. They're a collection of standard Bash functions that sweep all of the messy  grep s under the carpet. You can see the full collection of Standard Library functions in the  lib/  directory.  The Fifth Draft  The core  memcached  service is up and running, but there's still a few more tasks that need to be done. For example, maybe we want to create some users:  stdlib.groupadd --group jdoe --gid 999\nstdlib.useradd --user jdoe --uid 999 --gid 999 --comment  John  --shell /bin/bash --homedir /home/jdoe --createhome true  stdlib.useradd  is another Waffles Standard Library function that enables an easy way to create and manage a user on a server.  Looking at the above command, there are a lot of settings that are hard-coded. If we end up creating a  redis  server that also needs the  jdoe  user, we could just copy that line verbatim, but what about a scenario where the  uid  must be changed to  500 ? Then we'd need to change every occurrence of  999  to  500 . In large environments, there's a chance some changes would be missed.  To resolve this issue, Waffles allows settings such as this (known as  data ) to be stored in data files.  A simple way of using data is to just throw all settings into a file called  site/data/common.sh .  Let's add a user:  data_users=(\n  jdoe\n)\n\ndeclare -Ag data_user_info\ndata_user_info=(\n  [jdoe|uid]=999\n  [jdoe|gid]=999\n  [jdoe|comment]= John doe \n  [jdoe|homedir]= /home/jdoe \n  [jdoe|shell]= /bin/bash \n  [jdoe|create_home]=true\n)  Waffles data variables can be named anything, but if you want to follow the project standards, have the variables start with  data_ .  With all of this in place, the fifth draft now looks like:  #!/bin/bash\n\nsource ./waffles.conf\nsource ./lib/init.sh\n\nstdlib.data common\n\nfor user in  ${data_users[@]} ; do\n\n  homedir= ${data_user_info[${user}|homedir]} \n  uid= ${data_user_info[${user}|uid]} \n  gid= ${data_user_info[${user}|gid]} \n  comment= ${data_user_info[${user}|comment]} \n  shell= ${data_user_info[${user}|shell]} \n  create_home= ${data_user_info[${user}|create_home]} \n\n  stdlib.groupadd --group  $user  --gid  $gid \n  stdlib.useradd --state present --user  $user  --uid  $uid  --gid  $gid  --comment  $comment  --homedir  $homedir  --shell  $shell  --createhome  $createhome \n\ndone\n\nstdlib.apt --package memcached\nstdlib.file_line --name memcached.conf/listen --file /etc/memcached.conf --line  -l 0.0.0.0  --match  ^-l \nstdlib.sysvinit --name memcached\n\nif [  $stdlib_state_change  == true ]; then\n  /etc/init.d/memcached restart\nfi  The Sixth Draft  The block of user data can be re-used in other scripts. It'd be best if we just moved it out into its own separate script. By repeating this process, we can create a library of re-usable components. Final scripts then become \"compositions\" of the collection of scripts.  Create the directory structure  site/profiles/common/scripts  and add the following to  site/profiles/common/scripts/users.sh  for user in  ${data_users[@]} ; do\n\n  homedir= ${data_user_info[${user}|homedir]} \n  uid= ${data_user_info[${user}|uid]} \n  gid= ${data_user_info[${user}|gid]} \n  comment= ${data_user_info[${user}|comment]} \n  shell= ${data_user_info[${user}|shell]} \n  create_home= ${data_user_info[${user}|create_home]} \n\n  stdlib.groupadd --group  $user  --gid  $gid \n  stdlib.useradd --state present --user  $user  --uid  $uid  --gid  $gid  --comment  $comment  --homedir  $homedir  --shell  $shell  --createhome  $createhome \n\ndone  And so the sixth draft now looks like:  #!/bin/bash\n\nsource ./waffles.conf\nsource ./lib/init.sh\n\nstdlib.data common\nstdlib.profile common/users\n\nstdlib.apt --package memcached\nstdlib.file_line --name memcached.conf/listen --file /etc/memcached.conf --line  -l 0.0.0.0  --match  ^-l \nstdlib.sysvinit --name memcached\n\nif [  $stdlib_state_change  == true ]; then\n  /etc/init.d/memcached restart\nfi  You can create this script inside the Waffles directory (where  waffles.conf  is located), and run it like so:  bash test.sh  When you run it for the first time on a new server, it'll add the group, user, and set up  memcached . Run it multiple times and note how those same actions were not performed since the script detected that no changes needed to be made.",

Examples of roles could be:\n\n\n\n\nmemcached\n\n\nmemcached_apt\n\n\nmemcached_yum\n\n\nmemcached_yum_lxc\n\n\nmemcached_and_redis\n\n\n\n\nRole names are totally up to you -- just make sure \nyou\n understand that applying the \nmemcached_yum_lxc\n role to an Ubuntu-based KVM virtual machine probably won't work.\n\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we'll call our role \nmemcached\n.\n\n\nRoles are defined in \nsite/roles\n. \nsite\n is a special directory that will hold the configuration for your \nsite\n or environment. You most likely wouldn't be able to transfer \nsite\n to a new environment and have it run without some level of modification.\n\n\nNote: The location of the \nsite\n directory can be changed in \nwaffles.conf\n, but at this time, Waffles requires it to be in the main \nwaffles\n directory.\n\n\nA role is really just a Bash script, and if you'd prefer to just use Waffles to organize a collection of deployment scripts, go for it.\n\n\nTo use roles most effectively, think of them as glue between \ndata\n and \nprofiles\n:\n\n\n\n\nData is settings that make your site unique: user IDs, config file settings, package versions, etc.\n\n\nProfiles are small snippets of scripts that make up a unique service configuration.\n\n\n\n\nA very simple role could look like this:\n\n\n# Reads data from site/data/common.sh\nstdlib.data common\n\n# Reads data from site/data/memcached.sh\nstdlib.data memcached\n\n# Reads site/profiles/common/scripts/users.sh\nstdlib.profile common/users\n\n# Reads site/profiles/common/scripts/packages.sh\nstdlib.profile common/packages\n\n# Reads site/profiles/memcached/scripts/init.sh\nstdlib.profile memcached\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\nScripts stored in \nsite/data\n are, again, just regular Bash scripts. It's only by convention that you store data, and not programming logic, in these files.\n\n\nSo what is \"data\"? It's all of the settings that make your site or environment unique:\n\n\n\n\nIP Addresses\n\n\nUsernames, UIDs, GIDs\n\n\nPackage versions\n\n\nFirewall rules\n\n\n\n\nData files look like this:\n\n\ndata_memcached_listen=\n0.0.0.0\n\n\ndeclare -Ag data_user_info\ndata_user_info=(\n  [jdoe|uid]=999\n  [jdoe|gid]=999\n  [jdoe|comment]=\nJohn doe\n\n  [jdoe|homedir]=\n/home/jdoe\n\n  [jdoe|shell]=\n/bin/bash\n\n  [jdoe|create_home]=true\n)\n\n\n\n\nYou can name the variables anything you like, though the Waffles naming convention is to start each variable with \ndata_\n.\n\n\nNote: Bash associative arrays \nmust\n be declared as global variables. This is because all files are sourced inside a Bash function and, for whatever reason, associative arrays are not visible outside of a function (unlike all other Bash variable types).\n\n\nHierarchial Data\n\n\nBy declaring multiple data files in your role, you can create a hierarchy of data. For example:\n\n\nstdlib.data common\nstdlib.data memcached\n\n\n\n\nIn the above, common settings that are applicable to \nany\n role are stored in \nsite/data/common.sh\n. Only data relevant to the \nmemcached\n service is stored in \nsite/data/memcached.sh\n.\n\n\nYou can even declare the same variable in both data files. The data file declaring it last will overwrite all previous declarations and win.\n\n\nFinally, you can reference data from a previously declared data file. You can't, however, reference variables in data files \nbefore\n they are declared. To clarify: \nsite/data/memcached.sh\n can reference data from \nsite/data/common.sh\n, but not vice versa.\n\n\nData Structure\n\n\nThe placement of data files is flexible. You can do any of the following:\n\n\nstdlib.data common =\n data/common.sh\nstdlib.data common =\n data/common/init.sh\nstdlib.data common/users =\n data/common/users.sh\nstdlib.data memcached =\n data/memcached.sh\nstdlib.data memcached =\n data/memcached/init.sh\n\n\n\n\nProfiles\n\n\nProfiles are small snippets of bash scripts that are called from Roles. These profiles are run in a top-down fashion. Waffles does not support any other method of order.\n\n\nIt's possible to call Profiles from other Profiles, but that's not an encouraged practice.\n\n\nProfiles are meant to be shared among multiple roles. This easily makes sense for profiles like \ncommon/users\n, but when would you re-use \nmemcached\n? How about between a development and production environment? The same profile could be used in both roles and it would be the job of the data to provide the information that makes each environment different:\n\n\nDevelopment Memcached\n\n\nstdlib.data common\nstdlib.data development/memcached\n\nstdlib.profiles common/users\nstdlib.profiles common/packages\nstdlib.profiles memcached\n\n\n\n\nProduction Memcached\n\n\nstdlib.data common\nstdlib.data production/memcached\n\nstdlib.profiles common/users\nstdlib.profiles common/packages\nstdlib.profiles memcached\n\n\n\n\nWaffles does not enforce this pattern -- you are free to design your roles however you like.\n\n\nProfile Structure\n\n\nUnlike Data and Roles, Profiles have a standard structure to them:\n\n\nconsul/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 files\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 consul.conf\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 install_linux.sh\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 server.sh\n\n\n\n\nStatic files go under \nfiles\n while scripts go under \nscripts\n.\n\n\nWhen using the \nstdlib.file\n resource, you can use the \n--source\n option to copy files to their destination. The \n--source\n option is restricted to only being able to copy from the \nfiles\n directory.\n\n\nWhen declaring profiles in roles, the following translations happen:\n\n\nstdlib.profiles common/users =\n profiles/common/scripts/users.sh\nstdlib.profiles common/packages =\n profiles/common/scripts/packages.sh\nstdlib.profiles memcached =\n profiles/memcached/scripts/init.sh\nstdlib.profiles memcached/utils =\n profiles/memcached/scripts/utils.sh\n\n\n\n\nThe Hosts Profile\n\n\nWaffles supports an optional special profile called \nhost_files\n, located at \nsite/profiles/host_files\n. The purpose of this profile is to provide a designated area where files and scripts specific to individual hosts can be stored. This is beneficial because, normally, the entire profile is copied to each node that uses the profile. If you are storing files such as SSL certs in a profile, all SSL certs would be then copied to all hosts that share use the profile. This is probably not intended behavior.\n\n\nThe \nhost_files\n profile has the following structure:\n\n\nhost_files/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 mysql-01\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 files\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 mysql-01.crt\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 mysql-01.key\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 mysql-02\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 files\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 mysql-02.crt\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 mysql-02.key\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 rabbit-01\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 files\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 rabbit-01.crt\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 rabbit-01.key\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 custom.sh\n\n\n\n\nEach subdirectory of the \nhost_files\n profile is an individual host or node, named after the hostname (not FQDN). The directory of these subdirectories is like a normal profile with the usual \nfiles\n and \nscripts\n subdirectories.\n\n\nInside your role, you can enable this special profile by doing:\n\n\nstdlib.profile host_files\n\n\n\n\nThis means that a profile with the name \nhost_files\n is a reserved name.\n\n\nApplying Roles\n\n\nWaffles supports two ways of applying roles:\n\n\nLocal Execution\n\n\nYou can run \nwaffles.sh\n directly on a node and Waffles will apply the role to that node. This is most useful when you copy the entire contents of the \nwaffles\n directory to a node.\n\n\nRemote Execution (push)\n\n\nIt's possible to run Waffles on a remote node by pushing the configuration via rsync and SSH. To do this, use the \n-s \nserver\n flag. For example:\n\n\n$ waffles.sh -s www.example.com -r web\n\n\n\n\nNote: at this time, both the Waffles server and destination node must have rsync installed.\n\n\nRemote Execution (pull)\n\n\nWaffles does not support pull-based deployment yet.",

            "text": "Deploying a MySQL Server\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis guide will show one way of deploying a MySQL server with Waffles. In particular, Percona MySQL.\n\n\nSteps\n\n\nData\n\n\nThere will only be one data item: the MySQL root password. This example will store the password in plain text -- note that a best practice would be to install it either in an encrypted repository, an encrypted string, or something along those lines.\n\n\n$ cat site/data/mysql.sh\ndata_mysql_root_password=\npassword\n\n\n\n\n\nProfiles\n\n\nWe'll use two profile scripts for the MySQL server: the first will configure the Percona repo and the second will install and configure MySQL itself.\n\n\nFirst, make the directory structure\n\n\n$ mkdir -p site/profiles/mysql/scripts\n\n\n\n\nNext, make the repo profile script, located at \nsite/profiles/mysql/scripts/percona_repo.sh\n:\n\n\nstdlib.title \nmysql/percona/repo\n\n\nsource /etc/lsb-release\n\nstdlib.apt_key --name percona --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --key 1C4CBDCDCD2EFD2A\nstdlib.apt_source --name percona --uri http://repo.percona.com/apt --distribution $DISTRIB_CODENAME --component main --include_src true\n\n\n\n\nNext, make the MySQL profile script, located at \nsites/profilfes/mysql/scripts/percona_server.sh\n:\n\n\nstdlib.title \nmysql/percona/server\n\n\nhostname=$(hostname | sed -e 's/_/\\\\\\_/g')\n\nstdlib.apt --package percona-server-server-5.6\n\nmysql.user --user root --host localhost --password password\nmysql.mycnf --filename \n/root/.my.cnf\n --user root --password password\n\nmysql.user --state absent --user root --host 127.0.0.1 --password \n\nmysql.user --state absent --user root --host ::1 --password \n\nmysql.user --state absent --user \n --host localhost --password \n\nmysql.user --state absent --user root --host $hostname --password \n\nmysql.user --state absent --user \n --host $hostname --password \n\n\nmysql.database --state absent --name test\n\nstdlib.ini --file /etc/mysql/my.cnf --section mysqld --option bind-address --value 0.0.0.0\n\nif [[ $stdlib_state_change == true ]]; then\n  /etc/init.d/mysql restart\nfi\n\n\n\n\nThis script is rather simple in concept. Some notes about it:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nhostname\n variable is doing some shell escaping for MySQL commands.\n\n\nA \nroot@localhost\n user is being configured with the password set in the data file.\n\n\nMySQL installs several other default \nroot\n and \"blank\" users. We want to ensure these users are removed.\n\n\nWe also want to ensure that the \ntest\n database is removed.\n\n\nMySQL listens on localhost by default. We want it to listen on all interfaces, so we change the \nbind-address\n setting to \n0.0.0.0\n.\n\n\nThe special variable \n$stdlib_state_change\n will be \ntrue\n if any changes were made at all in the file. If they were, we want to restart the MySQL service. This will not happen if no changes were made.\n\n\n\n\nRoles\n\n\nFinally, combine the above Data and Profiles to build the role, located at \nsite/roles/mysql.sh\n:\n\n\nstdlib.enable_mysql\n\nstdlib.data mysql\n\nstdlib.profile mysql/percona_repo\nstdlib.profile mysql/percona_server\n\n\n\n\nThe \nstdlib.enable_mysql\n function is a special function that will source all of the relevant MySQL functions and resources located under \nlib\n.\n\n\nThe rest of the role should be self-explanatory.\n\n\nComments and Conclusion\n\n\nThe above example describes a simple way of deploying a Percona MySQL server using Waffles. It should be easy enough to modify and add other profiles to make a more well-rounded and robust service for you to use.",

Create \nsite/profiles/common/scripts/packages.sh\n with the following contents:\n\n\nstdlib.apt --package wget\nstdlib.apt --package software-properties-common\n\n\n\n\nConsul\n\n\nWe'll use two profile scripts for the Consul cluster: the first will install Consul and the second will set up the Consul cluster.\n\n\nFirst, make the directory structure\n\n\n$ mkdir -p site/profiles/consul/scripts\n\n\n\n\nNext, make the repo profile script, located at \nsite/profiles/consul/scripts/install.sh\n:\n\n\nstdlib.title \nprofiles/consul/install\n\n\nstdlib.apt --package unzip\n\nstdlib.useradd --user consul --homedir /var/lib/consul --createhome true\nstdlib.directory --name /etc/consul.d --owner consul --group consul\n\nif [[ ! -f /usr/local/bin/consul ]]; then\n  stdlib.mute pushd /tmp\n  stdlib.capture_error wget https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/consul/${data_consul_version}_linux_amd64.zip\n  stdlib.capture_error unzip ${data_consul_version}_linux_amd64.zip\n  stdlib.capture_error mv consul /usr/local/bin\n  stdlib.mute popd\nfi\n\n\n\n\nThis install script is rather simple. It's doing the following:\n\n\n\n\nInstalls the \nunzip\n package\n\n\nCreates a \nconsul\n system user with a homedir of \n/var/lib/consul\n\n\nDownloads the Consul binary of the version we specified in the data\n\n\nUnzips it and installs it to \n/usr/local/bin\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote: the way this script determines if Consul is installed is by the presence of the \n/usr/local/bin/consul\n file. If this method is too simplistic for you, feel free to package Consul into a \ndeb\n or \nrpm\n package.\n\n\nNext, make the Consul server script, located at \nsites/profiles/consul/scripts/server.sh\n:\n\n\nstdlib.title \nprofiles/consul/server\n\n\nstdlib.file --name /etc/init/consul.conf --source \n$WAFFLES_SITE_DIR/profiles/consul/files/consul.conf\n\n\nfor key in \n${!data_consul_config[@]}\n; do\n  augeas.json_dict --file /etc/consul.d/config.json --path / --key \n$key\n --value \n${data_consul_config[$key]}\n\ndone\n\nstdlib.upstart --name consul --state running\n\nhostname=$(hostname)\nif [[ $hostname == $data_consul_bootstrap_node ]]; then\n  sleep 10\n  for i in \n${data_consul_nodes[@]}\n; do\n    if [[ $hostname != $i ]]; then\n      /usr/local/bin/consul join $i\n    fi\n  done\nfi\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some notes on the above:\n\n\n\n\nstdlib.file\n is able to copy a static file from \nsite/profiles/consul/files\n. It is \nhighly\n recommended to bundle your static files into the profile that they are being called from. This ensures that they get copied to the remote node during remote deployment. Alternatively, while there are not yet resources for commands such as \nscp\n or \nwget\n, you could use them similarly to how the Consul zip file was downloaded.\n\n\naugeas.json_dict\n is an Augeas-based resource that allows JSON files to be built on the command-line. In order to use Augeas, it must be installed. See the next section.\n\n\nstdlib.upstart\n ensures that the Consul service is running.\n\n\nFinally, the \nfor\n loop will run if the node is the bootstrap node. It'll loop through all other existing nodes and join them. The existing nodes must be up and running first, which is why the bootstrap node was set to the last node in the cluster.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, create \nsite/profiles/consul/files/consul.conf\n with the following content:\n\n\ndescription \nConsul agent\n\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nrespawn\n\nscript\n  if [ -f \n/etc/default/consul\n ]; then\n    # Gives us the CONSUL_FLAGS variable\n    . /etc/default/consul\n  fi\n\n  # Make sure to use all our CPUs, because Consul can block a scheduler thread\n  export GOMAXPROCS=`nproc`\n\n  exec /usr/local/bin/consul agent \\\n    -config-dir=\n/etc/consul.d\n \\\n    ${CONSUL_FLAGS} \\\n    \n/var/log/consul.log 2\n1\nend script\n\n\n\n\nAugeas\n\n\nTo install Augeas, create \nsite/profiles/augeas/scripts/install_apt.sh\n with the following content:\n\n\nstdlib.title \nprofiles/augeas/install_apt\n\n\nstdlib.apt_ppa --ppa raphink/augeas\nstdlib.apt --package augeas-tools --version latest\n\n\n\n\nRoles\n\n\nFinally, combine the above Data and Profiles to build the role, located at \nsite/roles/consul.sh\n:\n\n\nstdlib.enable_augeas\n\nstdlib.data consul\n\nstdlib.profile common/packages\nstdlib.profile augeas/install_apt\nstdlib.profile consul/install\nstdlib.profile consul/server\n\n\n\n\nThe \nstdlib.enable_augeas\n function is a special function that will source all of the relevant Augeas functions and resources located under \nlib\n.\n\n\nThe rest of the role should be self-explanatory.\n\n\nRun\n\n\nYou should now run this against 3 servers, containers, or virtual machines of your choice.\n\n\nComments and Conclusion\n\n\nThe above example describes a simple way of deploying a Consul cluster using Waffles.

Create  site/profiles/common/scripts/packages.sh  with the following contents:  stdlib.apt --package wget\nstdlib.apt --package software-properties-common  Consul  We'll use two profile scripts for the Consul cluster: the first will install Consul and the second will set up the Consul cluster.  First, make the directory structure  $ mkdir -p site/profiles/consul/scripts  Next, make the repo profile script, located at  site/profiles/consul/scripts/install.sh :  stdlib.title  profiles/consul/install \n\nstdlib.apt --package unzip\n\nstdlib.useradd --user consul --homedir /var/lib/consul --createhome true\nstdlib.directory --name /etc/consul.d --owner consul --group consul\n\nif [[ ! -f /usr/local/bin/consul ]]; then\n  stdlib.mute pushd /tmp\n  stdlib.capture_error wget https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/consul/${data_consul_version}_linux_amd64.zip\n  stdlib.capture_error unzip ${data_consul_version}_linux_amd64.zip\n  stdlib.capture_error mv consul /usr/local/bin\n  stdlib.mute popd\nfi  This install script is rather simple.

Note: the way this script determines if Consul is installed is by the presence of the  /usr/local/bin/consul  file. If this method is too simplistic for you, feel free to package Consul into a  deb  or  rpm  package.  Next, make the Consul server script, located at  sites/profiles/consul/scripts/server.sh :  stdlib.title  profiles/consul/server \n\nstdlib.file --name /etc/init/consul.conf --source  $WAFFLES_SITE_DIR/profiles/consul/files/consul.conf \n\nfor key in  ${!data_consul_config[@]} ; do\n  augeas.json_dict --file /etc/consul.d/config.json --path / --key  $key  --value  ${data_consul_config[$key]} \ndone\n\nstdlib.upstart --name consul --state running\n\nhostname=$(hostname)\nif [[ $hostname == $data_consul_bootstrap_node ]]; then\n  sleep 10\n  for i in  ${data_consul_nodes[@]} ; do\n    if [[ $hostname != $i ]]; then\n      /usr/local/bin/consul join $i\n    fi\n  done\nfi  Here are some notes on the above:   stdlib.file  is able to copy a static file from  site/profiles/consul/files . It is  highly  recommended to bundle your static files into the profile that they are being called from. This ensures that they get copied to the remote node during remote deployment. Alternatively, while there are not yet resources for commands such as  scp  or  wget , you could use them similarly to how the Consul zip file was downloaded.  augeas.json_dict  is an Augeas-based resource that allows JSON files to be built on the command-line. In order to use Augeas, it must be installed. See the next section.  stdlib.upstart  ensures that the Consul service is running.  Finally, the  for  loop will run if the node is the bootstrap node. It'll loop through all other existing nodes and join them. The existing nodes must be up and running first, which is why the bootstrap node was set to the last node in the cluster.   Finally, create  site/profiles/consul/files/consul.conf  with the following content:  description  Consul agent \n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nrespawn\n\nscript\n  if [ -f  /etc/default/consul  ]; then\n    # Gives us the CONSUL_FLAGS variable\n    . /etc/default/consul\n  fi\n\n  # Make sure to use all our CPUs, because Consul can block a scheduler thread\n  export GOMAXPROCS=`nproc`\n\n  exec /usr/local/bin/consul agent \\\n    -config-dir= /etc/consul.d  \\\n    ${CONSUL_FLAGS} \\\n     /var/log/consul.log 2 1\nend script  Augeas  To install Augeas, create  site/profiles/augeas/scripts/install_apt.sh  with the following content:  stdlib.title  profiles/augeas/install_apt \n\nstdlib.apt_ppa --ppa raphink/augeas\nstdlib.apt --package augeas-tools --version latest  Roles  Finally, combine the above Data and Profiles to build the role, located at  site/roles/consul.sh :  stdlib.enable_augeas\n\nstdlib.data consul\n\nstdlib.profile common/packages\nstdlib.profile augeas/install_apt\nstdlib.profile consul/install\nstdlib.profile consul/server  The  stdlib.enable_augeas  function is a special function that will source all of the relevant Augeas functions and resources located under  lib .

Instructions can be found on Terraform's \nhomepage\n.\n\n\nCreating a Terraform Configuration\n\n\nThe following Terraform Configuration is all that is required to use Waffles with Terraform:\n\n\nresource \nopenstack_compute_keypair_v2\n \nwaffles\n {\n  name = \nwaffles\n\n  public_key = \n${file(\n/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n)}\n\n}\n\nresource \nopenstack_compute_instance_v2\n \nwaffles\n {\n  name = \nwaffles\n\n  image_name = \nUbuntu 14.04\n\n  flavor_name = \nm1.tiny\n\n\n  key_pair = \n${openstack_compute_keypair_v2.waffles.name}\n\n  security_groups = [\ndefault\n]\n\n  connection {\n    user = \nubuntu\n\n    key_file = \n/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n\n    host = \n${openstack_compute_instance_v2.waffles.access_ip_v6}\n\n  }\n\n  provisioner \nlocal-exec\n {\n    command = \nsleep 10 \n cd /root/.waffles \n bash waffles.sh -r memcached -s ${openstack_compute_instance_v2.waffles.access_ip_v6} -u ubuntu -y\n\n  }\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nSave the above as something like \n~/waffles-tform/main.tf\n\n\nApply the Terraform Configuration\n\n\nNow just apply the configuration with:\n\n\n$ cd waffles-tform\n$ terraform apply\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\nThe above configuration makes a few assumptions:\n\n\n\n\nrsync\n is already installed on the image you'll be using. If yours doesn't, use \ncloud-init\n or a similar system to pre-install it.\n\n\nThe virtual machine that Terraform creates is accessible via IPv6. If yours isn't, either attach a Floating or Elastic IP or use the fixed IP somehow.\n\n\nThe SSH key being used is \n/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n. This is because Waffles does not support non-default SSH keys yet.\n\n\nSSH access is allowed through the security group.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThis guide showed one way of using Waffles with Terraform. Both systems are extremely flexible and complement each other well, so there may be other ways of achieving the same result.\n\n\nFor example, you could use Terraform's \nfile\n provisioner to copy the entire \n~/.waffles\n directory to the remote virtual machine. The benefit of using Waffles's built-in push is that only the files which the role requires are copied over.",

Creating a Terraform Configuration  The following Terraform Configuration is all that is required to use Waffles with Terraform:  resource  openstack_compute_keypair_v2   waffles  {\n  name =  waffles \n  public_key =  ${file( /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub )} \n}\n\nresource  openstack_compute_instance_v2   waffles  {\n  name =  waffles \n  image_name =  Ubuntu 14.04 \n  flavor_name =  m1.tiny \n\n  key_pair =  ${openstack_compute_keypair_v2.waffles.name} \n  security_groups = [ default ]\n\n  connection {\n    user =  ubuntu \n    key_file =  /root/.ssh/id_rsa \n    host =  ${openstack_compute_instance_v2.waffles.access_ip_v6} \n  }\n\n  provisioner  local-exec  {\n    command =  sleep 10   cd /root/.waffles   bash waffles.sh -r memcached -s ${openstack_compute_instance_v2.waffles.access_ip_v6} -u ubuntu -y \n  }\n\n}  Save the above as something like  ~/waffles-tform/main.tf  Apply the Terraform Configuration  Now just apply the configuration with:  $ cd waffles-tform\n$ terraform apply",

If yours doesn't, use  cloud-init  or a similar system to pre-install it.  The virtual machine that Terraform creates is accessible via IPv6. If yours isn't, either attach a Floating or Elastic IP or use the fixed IP somehow.  The SSH key being used is  /root/.ssh/id_rsa . This is because Waffles does not support non-default SSH keys yet.  SSH access is allowed through the security group.",

Both systems are extremely flexible and complement each other well, so there may be other ways of achieving the same result.  For example, you could use Terraform's  file  provisioner to copy the entire  ~/.waffles  directory to the remote virtual machine. The benefit of using Waffles's built-in push is that only the files which the role requires are copied over.",

            "text": "Waffles Resources\n\n\nThis document will cover how resources are used in Waffles.\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nAll resources are stored in the \n$WAFFLES_DIR/lib\n directory:\n\n\n\n\nThe Standard Library of resources is located in \n$WAFFLES_DIR/lib/resources\n.\n\n\nApache-based resources are located in \n$WAFFLES_DIR/lib/apache\n.\n\n\nAugeas-based resources are located in \n$WAFFLES_DIR/lib/augeas\n.\n\n\nConsul-based resources are located in \n$WAFFLES_DIR/lib/consul\n.\n\n\nKeepalived-based resources are located in \n$WAFFLES_DIR/lib/keepalived\n.\n\n\nMySQL-based resources are located in \n$WAFFLES_DIR/lib/mysql\n.\n\n\nNginx-based resources are located in \n$WAFFLES_DIR/lib/nginx\n.\n\n\nRabbitMQ-based resources are located in \n$WAFFLES_DIR/lib/rabbitmq\n.\n\n\n\n\nEnabling Non-Standard Resources\n\n\nBy default, only the Standard Library is enabled in Waffles. To enable the other resources, use the following functions:\n\n\n\n\nApache: \nstdlib.enable_apache\n\n\nAugeas: \nstdlib.enable_augeas\n\n\nConsul: \nstdlib.enable_consul\n\n\nKeepalived: \nstdlib.enable_keepalived\n\n\nMySQL: \nstdlib.enable_mysql\n\n\nNginx: \nstdlib.enable_nginx\n\n\nRabbitMQ: \nstdlib.enable_rabbitmq\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a Resource\n\n\nHeader\n\n\nEach resource has a detailed comment header. This header describes what the resource does, what parameters it takes, how to use it, and any comments. The comment header is very important as this is where the resource documentation is generated from.\n\n\nfunction resource.name\n\n\nThe next part of a resource is the first \"function\". This first function is named after the resource name. So any time you use a resource, you're actually just calling a Bash function.\n\n\nThe first thing done inside this function is to call a \"subtitle\" with \nstdlib.subtitle\n. Subtitles serve two purposes:\n\n\n\n\nThey set the name to be printed when running Waffles.\n\n\nThey reset an internal flag for changes made in the resource. This flag is called \nstdlib_resource_change\n. See the \"State Changes\" section for more details.\n\n\n\n\nNext, an \noptions\n variable is declared. It is important that this variable is declared in each resource. If not, then the resource will share variables with the last called resource. After the \noptions\n variable is declared, any parameters for the resource are declared. Finally, variables are checked via \nstdlib.options.parse_options\n. All logic related to \noptions\n can be found in \n$WAFFLES_DIR/lib/options.sh\n.\n\n\nAfter options, any local variables are defined.\n\n\nNext, any optional custom logic is defined. This usually includes local variables just for the resource or ensuring that correctly formatted parameters were given.\n\n\nNext, \nstdlib.resource.process\n is called.\n\n\nfunction stdlib.resource.process\n\n\nThis is a centralized function that was introduced to help reduce repeated code in all resources. It does the following:\n\n\n\n\nA catalog entry is made.\n\n\nstdlib.resource.read\n is called, which in turn calls \ncalling_resource.read\n.\n\n\nA comparison is made of the resource state versus the state that the resource should be in.\n\n\nDepending on the results of the above, \nstdlib.resource.x\n is called, which in turn calls \ncalling_resource.x\n.\n\n\n\n\nEach of the \nstdlib.resource.x\n functions do a few other things like determine if a resource change was made and how many changes were made throughout the entire run. In the future, these functions may also generate summary reports of the run.\n\n\nfunction resource.name.x\n\n\nThe rest of the resource is made up of four standard functions:\n\n\n\n\nfunction.name.read\n\n\nfunction.name.create\n\n\nfunction.name.update\n\n\nfunction.name.delete\n\n\n\n\nSome resources contain extra functions, but they always tie back into those standard four. Sometimes \nfunction.name.update\n just calls \ndelete\n and \ncreate\n.\n\n\nIf you create a resource that conforms to those four functions, it'll work just fine in Waffles.\n\n\nfunction resource.name.read\n\n\nThe \nread\n function determines the current state of the resource. For example, \nstdlib.apt.read\n determines if the package is installed, and if so, what version is installed.\n\n\nfunction resource.name.create\n\n\nThe \ncreate\n function does whatever is required to create the the resource. For example, \nstdlib.apt.create\n installs a package via \napt\n and \nstdlib.file_line.create\n adds a line to a given file either by \necho\n or \nsed\n.\n\n\nIt's important to try to stick with a core philosophy of Waffles: use standard nix utilities for the creation of resources.\n\n\nfunction resource.name.update\n\n\nIf the work required to update a resource is different than creating a resource, use the \nupdate\n function. However, if it's easier to simply delete the resource and recreate it, then do that instead of an update function. Just don't use that method as an excuse.\n\n\nfunction resource.name.delete\n\n\nThis function deletes the resource. For example, \nstdlib.apt.delete\n will actually remove the package.\n\n\nState Changes\n\n\nAfter you call a resource, you can check the status of the \nstdlib_resource_change\n flag. If it is true, then a change happened when you called the resource. For example:\n\n\nstdlib.apt --package sl --version latest\n\nif [[ $stdlib_resource_change == \ntrue\n ]]; then\n  stdlib.info \nPackage sl was installed or upgraded.\n\nfi\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to \nstdlib_resource_change\n is \nstdlib_state_change\n. \nstdlib_state_change\n works in the exact same way, but it is reset when a call to \nstdlib.title\n is made. You usually use \nstdlib.title\n at the beginning of Profiles.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nUse the Standard Library and Augeas resources as examples of how resources are built.",
