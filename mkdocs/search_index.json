You can use Waffles without these components, but Augeas makes handling certain situations easier.\n\n\nWhy Bash?\n\n\nI chose Bash over another language such as Python, Ruby, Golang, etc because:\n\n\n\n\nBash is available on every Linux distribution out of the box. It's easy to install on FreeBSD and similar nix systems.\n\n\nConfiguring a nix-based system is all about running commands in a sequence as well as editing text files. This is exactly what Bash and the core utilities do.\n\n\nSome configuration management systems just create Bash subprocesses to perform the underlying system changes anyway.\n\n\n\n\nWhy \"Waffles\"?\n\n\nI had all sorts of names for this project. \"Composite\" was the longest running name, but I always felt it was kind of boring. \nHecubus\n was another front-runner. I eventually settled on \"Waffles\" because I wanted a name that was simple and wasn't too serious. And it's one of the first words I hear every morning when my son asks \"wa-foos?\".\n\n\nContributing\n\n\nAll kinds of contributions are welcome:\n\n\n\n\nMore docs\n\n\nMore resources\n\n\nBetter ways of accomplishing something",

It's a single daemon with a single configuration file installed from a single package.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \"package, file, service\" pattern is very convenient for structuring service configurations.\n\n\n\n\nLet's say we want to create a \nmemcached\n server on a Linux container or virtual machine. Rather than running the commands manually, we'll create a Bash script to do the work. This will serve two purposes:\n\n\n\n\nBuild Documentation\n\n\nRepeatable process\n\n\n\n\nThe First Draft\n\n\nThe initial Bash script would look something like:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\napt-get install -y memcached\n\n\n\n\nThe Second Draft\n\n\nThis works, and doing \nps aux\n shows that \nmemcached\n is running. But notice that \nmemcached\n is only listening on \nlocalhost\n:\n\n\n$ netstat -nap | grep 11211\n\n\n\n\nSince this \nmemcached\n service will be used by other services on the network, we need to change \nmemcached\n's interface binding to \n0.0.0.0\n. The following should work:\n\n\n$ sed -i -e '/^-l 127.0.0.1$/c -l 0.0.0.0' /etc/memcached.conf\n$ /etc/init.d/memcached restart\n\n\n\n\nAnd once that's tested on the command line, we add it to our script:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\napt-get install -y memcached\nsed -i -e '/^-l 127.0.0.1$/c -l 0.0.0.0' /etc/memcached.conf\n/etc/init.d/memcached restart\n\n\n\n\nAstute readers will see an issue. In order for us to test this script, we need to run it again. However, the script is going to report that \nmemcached\n is already installed and an unnecessary restart of \nmemcached\n will take place.\n\n\nThere are two ways to resolve this issue:\n\n\nThe first is by starting over from scratch and running the script on a new server. There's a lot of merit to this method. For example, you can be sure that the exact steps work in sequence on new servers. However, the entire process could take a long time for some situations. Also, what if this \nmemcached\n service was in production? Either you'd have to take the \nmemcached\n service down temporarily while the new service builds or you'd have to find some way of seamlessly adding in the new service while removing the old. While there's benefit to this (which is similar to the current popularity of \"microservices\"), it may not always be a possible solution.\n\n\nThe second way is to alter the script so that changes are only made if required. If a change does not need to be made, nothing happens.\n\n\nLet's say it's not possible for us to rebuild from scratch. Therefore, we'll opt for the second option.\n\n\nThe Third Draft\n\n\nIn order to run our Bash script against a running service without causing (too much of) a disruption, we must ensure that each step is executed only if it needs to be. This means that before any command has run, we must check to see what the current state of the system is, compare it to the change we want to make, and only make the change if the system state does not match.\n\n\nBy doing this, our Bash script becomes a \"state declaration\" that describes how the \nmemcached\n service should be configured when the script is done running. This is known as \nIdempotence\n in Configuration Management.\n\n\nSo let's make our basic Bash script more idempotent:\n\n\ndpkg -s memcached \n/dev/null\nif [ $? == 1 ]; then\n  echo \nInstalling memcached\n\n  apt-get install -y memcached\nfi\n\ngrep -q '^-l 127.0.0.1' /etc/memcached.conf\nif [ $? == 0 ]; then\n  echo \nUpdating memcached.conf and restarting it.\n\n  sed -i -e '/^-l 127.0.0.1$/c -l 0.0.0.0' /etc/memcached.conf\n  /etc/init.d/memcached restart\nfi\n\n\n\n\nWith this in place, we can now execute this script multiple times on the same server, virtual machine, or container, and if a step has already been done it will not happen again.\n\n\nThe Fourth Draft\n\n\nHaving to do a bunch of \ngrep\ns and other checks can become very tedious. Waffles tries to resolve this by including a Standard Library of common tasks. Using the Waffles Standard Library, the above script can be re-written as:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsource ./waffles.conf\nsource ./lib/init.sh\n\nstdlib.apt --package memcached\nstdlib.file_line --name memcached.conf/listen --file /etc/memcached.conf --line \n-l 0.0.0.0\n --match \n^-l\n\nstdlib.sysvinit --name memcached\n\nif [ \n$stdlib_state_change\n == true ]; then\n  /etc/init.d/memcached restart\nfi\n\n\n\n\nThere's nothing magical about these commands. They're a collection of standard Bash functions that sweep all of the messy \ngrep\ns under the carpet. You can see the full collection of Standard Library functions in the \nlib/\n directory.\n\n\nThe Fifth Draft\n\n\nThe core \nmemcached\n service is up and running, but there's still a few more tasks that need to be done. For example, maybe we want to create some users:\n\n\nstdlib.groupadd --group jdoe --gid 999\nstdlib.useradd --user jdoe --uid 999 --gid 999 --comment \nJohn\n --shell /bin/bash --homedir /home/jdoe --createhome true\n\n\n\n\nstdlib.useradd\n is another Waffles Standard Library function that enables an easy way to create and manage a user on a server.\n\n\nLooking at the above command, there are a lot of settings that are hard-coded. If we end up creating a \nredis\n server that also needs the \njdoe\n user, we could just copy that line verbatim, but what about a scenario where the \nuid\n must be changed to \n500\n? Then we'd need to change every occurrence of \n999\n to \n500\n. In large environments, there's a chance some changes would be missed.\n\n\nTo resolve this issue, Waffles allows settings such as this (known as \ndata\n) to be stored in data files.\n\n\nA simple way of using data is to just throw all settings into a file called \nsite/data/common.sh\n.\n\n\nLet's add a user:\n\n\ndata_users=(\n  jdoe\n)\n\ndeclare -Ag data_user_info\ndata_user_info=(\n  [jdoe|uid]=999\n  [jdoe|gid]=999\n  [jdoe|comment]=\nJohn doe\n\n  [jdoe|homedir]=\n/home/jdoe\n\n  [jdoe|shell]=\n/bin/bash\n\n  [jdoe|create_home]=true\n)\n\n\n\n\nWaffles data variables can be named anything, but if you want to follow the project standards, have the variables start with \ndata_\n.\n\n\nWith all of this in place, the fifth draft now looks like:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsource ./waffles.conf\nsource ./lib/init.sh\n\nstdlib.data common\n\nfor user in \n${data_users[@]}\n; do\n\n  homedir=\n${data_user_info[${user}|homedir]}\n\n  uid=\n${data_user_info[${user}|uid]}\n\n  gid=\n${data_user_info[${user}|gid]}\n\n  comment=\n${data_user_info[${user}|comment]}\n\n  shell=\n${data_user_info[${user}|shell]}\n\n  create_home=\n${data_user_info[${user}|create_home]}\n\n\n  stdlib.groupadd --group \n$user\n --gid \n$gid\n\n  stdlib.useradd --state present --user \n$user\n --uid \n$uid\n --gid \n$gid\n --comment \n$comment\n --homedir \n$homedir\n --shell \n$shell\n --createhome \n$createhome\n\n\ndone\n\nstdlib.apt --package memcached\nstdlib.file_line --name memcached.conf/listen --file /etc/memcached.conf --line \n-l 0.0.0.0\n --match \n^-l\n\nstdlib.sysvinit --name memcached\n\nif [ \n$stdlib_state_change\n == true ]; then\n  /etc/init.d/memcached restart\nfi\n\n\n\n\nThe Sixth Draft\n\n\nThe block of user data can be re-used in other scripts. It'd be best if we just moved it out into its own separate script. By repeating this process, we can create a library of re-usable components. Final scripts then become \"compositions\" of the collection of scripts.\n\n\nCreate the directory structure \nsite/profiles/common/scripts\n and add the following to \nsite/profiles/common/scripts/users.sh\n\n\nfor user in \n${data_users[@]}\n; do\n\n  homedir=\n${data_user_info[${user}|homedir]}\n\n  uid=\n${data_user_info[${user}|uid]}\n\n  gid=\n${data_user_info[${user}|gid]}\n\n  comment=\n${data_user_info[${user}|comment]}\n\n  shell=\n${data_user_info[${user}|shell]}\n\n  create_home=\n${data_user_info[${user}|create_home]}\n\n\n  stdlib.groupadd --group \n$user\n --gid \n$gid\n\n  stdlib.useradd --state present --user \n$user\n --uid \n$uid\n --gid \n$gid\n --comment \n$comment\n --homedir \n$homedir\n --shell \n$shell\n --createhome \n$createhome\n\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\nAnd so the sixth draft now looks like:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsource ./waffles.conf\nsource ./lib/init.sh\n\nstdlib.data common\nstdlib.profile common/users\n\nstdlib.apt --package memcached\nstdlib.file_line --name memcached.conf/listen --file /etc/memcached.conf --line \n-l 0.0.0.0\n --match \n^-l\n\nstdlib.sysvinit --name memcached\n\nif [ \n$stdlib_state_change\n == true ]; then\n  /etc/init.d/memcached restart\nfi\n\n\n\n\nYou can create this script inside the Waffles directory (where \nwaffles.conf\n is located), and run it like so:\n\n\nbash test.sh\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run it for the first time on a new server, it'll add the group, user, and set up \nmemcached\n. Run it multiple times and note how those same actions were not performed since the script detected that no changes needed to be made.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nAt this point, we've effectively recreated the core of Waffles. The rest of controls how Waffles runs and where to find various files that Waffles needs to read.",

By default, this directory is \nwaffles/site\n, but you can change it by setting \nWAFFLES_SITE_DIR\n in either:\n\n\n\n\nThe environment (environment variable)\n\n\nThe \nwaffles/waffles.conf\n file\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSee the \nEnvironment Variables\n Guide for more information.\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\nData files are stored in \nsite/data\n. They're regular Bash scripts and it's only by convention that you store \"data\", and not programming logic, in these files.\n\n\nSo what is \"data\"? It's all of the settings that make your site or environment unique:\n\n\n\n\nIP Addresses\n\n\nUsernames, UIDs, GIDs\n\n\nPackage versions\n\n\nFirewall rules\n\n\n\n\nA Data file called \nmemcached.sh\n could look like this:\n\n\ndata_memcached_listen=\n0.0.0.0\n\n\ndeclare -Ag data_user_info\ndata_user_info=(\n  [jdoe|uid]=999\n  [jdoe|gid]=999\n  [jdoe|comment]=\nJohn doe\n\n  [jdoe|homedir]=\n/home/jdoe\n\n  [jdoe|shell]=\n/bin/bash\n\n  [jdoe|create_home]=true\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can name the variables anything you'd like, though the Waffles naming convention is to start each variable with \ndata_\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nBash associative arrays \nmust\n be declared as global variables. This is because all files are sourced inside a Bash function and, for whatever reason, associative arrays are not visible outside of a function (unlike all other Bash variable types).\n\n\n\n\nReferencing Data\n\n\nOnce you've created some \"data\" in a data file, you can refer to it by doing the following:\n\n\nstdlib.data memcached\n\necho $data_memcached_listen\n\n\n\n\nstdlib.data\n is a function that takes a single argument: the name of a data file.\n\n\nData Structure\n\n\nThe placement of data files is flexible. You can do any of the following:\n\n\nstdlib.data common       =\n site/data/common.sh\nstdlib.data common       =\n site/data/common/init.sh\nstdlib.data common/users =\n site/data/common/users.sh\nstdlib.data memcached    =\n site/data/memcached.sh\nstdlib.data memcached    =\n site/data/memcached/init.sh\n\n\n\n\nHierarchial Data\n\n\nBy declaring multiple data files in your role, you can create a hierarchy of data. For example:\n\n\nstdlib.data common\nstdlib.data memcached\n\n\n\n\nIn the above, common settings that are applicable to \nany\n role are stored in \nsite/data/common.sh\n. Only data relevant to the \nmemcached\n service is stored in \nsite/data/memcached.sh\n.\n\n\nYou can even declare the same variable in both data files. The data file declaring it last will overwrite all previous declarations and win.\n\n\nFinally, you can reference data from a previously declared data file. You can't, however, reference variables in data files \nbefore\n they are declared. To clarify: \nsite/data/memcached.sh\n can reference data from \nsite/data/common.sh\n, but not vice versa.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSee the \nReferencing Data from Data\n and \nOverriding Data\n Guides for more information.\n\n\n\n\nProfiles\n\n\nProfiles are small snippets of bash scripts stored under \nsite/profiles\n. They are meant to be distinct units of work that accomplish a single task.\n\n\nFor example, you may have a Profile that installs the \nmemcached\n package, a Profile that configures \n/etc/memcached.conf\n, and a Profile that sets up the \nmemcached\n daemon. Or you may choose to have a single Profile that does all three tasks. Waffles does not enforce any rules to how you design your Profiles.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIt's possible to call Profiles from other Profiles, but that's not an encouraged practice.\n\n\n\n\nProfile Structure\n\n\nProfiles have a standard structure to them:\n\n\nsite/profiles/consul/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 files\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 consul.conf\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 install_linux.sh\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 server.sh\n\n\n\n\nStatic files go under \nfiles\n while scripts go under \nscripts\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen using the \nstdlib.file\n resource, you can use the \n--source\n option to copy files to their destination. The \n--source\n option is able to reference any file on the system. It's recommended to use \n$WAFFLES_SITE_DIR/profiles/profile_name/files/file.conf\n when \"sourcing\" a file.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nstdlib.profile\n function is similar to \nstdlib.data\n: it takes a single argument, which is the name of a profile. The following translations are possible:\n\n\nstdlib.profile common/users    =\n site/profiles/common/scripts/users.sh\nstdlib.profile common/packages =\n site/profiles/common/scripts/packages.sh\nstdlib.profile memcached       =\n site/profiles/memcached/scripts/init.sh\nstdlib.profile memcached/utils =\n site/profiles/memcached/scripts/utils.sh\n\n\n\n\nThe Hosts Profile\n\n\nWaffles supports an optional special profile called \nhost_files\n, located at \nsite/profiles/host_files\n. The purpose of this profile is to provide a designated area where files and scripts specific to individual hosts can be stored. This is beneficial because, normally, the entire profile is copied to each node that uses the profile. If you are storing files such as SSL certs in a profile, all SSL certs would be then copied to all hosts that share use the profile. This is probably not the intended behavior.\n\n\nThe \nhost_files\n profile has the following structure:\n\n\nsite/profiles/host_files/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 mysql-01\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 files\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 mysql-01.crt\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 mysql-01.key\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 mysql-02\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 files\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 mysql-02.crt\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 mysql-02.key\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 rabbit-01\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 files\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 rabbit-01.crt\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 rabbit-01.key\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 custom.sh\n\n\n\n\nEach subdirectory of the \nhost_files\n profile is an individual host or node, named after the hostname (not FQDN). The directory of these subdirectories is like a normal profile with the usual \nfiles\n and \nscripts\n subdirectories.\n\n\nInside your role, you can enable this special profile by doing:\n\n\nstdlib.profile host_files\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThis means that \nhost_files\n is a reserved name.\n\n\n\n\nRoles\n\n\nA \"role\" is a name that identifies a unique configuration set. Examples of roles could be:\n\n\n\n\nmemcached\n\n\nmemcached_apt\n\n\nmemcached_yum\n\n\nmemcached_yum_lxc\n\n\nmemcached_and_redis\n\n\n\n\nRole names are up to you -- just make sure \nyou\n understand that applying the \nmemcached_yum_lxc\n role to an Ubuntu-based KVM virtual machine probably won't work.\n\n\nRoles are defined in \nsite/roles\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nA role is really just another Bash script. It's possible to use Waffles to organize a collection of deployment scripts simply by placing them under the \nsite/roles\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nTo use roles most effectively, think of them as glue between \ndata\n and \nprofiles\n:\n\n\nA very simple role could look like this:\n\n\n# Reads data from site/data/common.sh\nstdlib.data common\n\n# Reads data from site/data/memcached.sh\nstdlib.data memcached\n\n# Reads site/profiles/common/scripts/users.sh\nstdlib.profile common/users\n\n# Reads site/profiles/common/scripts/packages.sh\nstdlib.profile common/packages\n\n# Reads site/profiles/memcached/scripts/init.sh\nstdlib.profile memcached\n\n\n\n\nApplying Roles\n\n\nWaffles supports two ways of applying roles:\n\n\nLocal Execution\n\n\nYou can run \nwaffles.sh\n directly on a node and Waffles will apply the role to that node. For example:\n\n\n$ waffles.sh -r memcached\n\n\n\n\nThis is most useful when you copy the entire contents of the \nwaffles\n directory to a node, log into the node, and manually run \nwaffles.sh\n.\n\n\nRemote Execution (push)\n\n\nIt's possible to run Waffles on a remote node by pushing the configuration via rsync and SSH. To do this, use the \n-s \nserver\n flag. For example:\n\n\n$ waffles.sh -s www.example.com -r web\n\n\n\n\nThe benefit of this method is that only the data and profiles referenced in the role will be copied to the remote node. So if you have several other profiles, such as for MySQL or RabbitMQ, those profiles will not be copied to a node acting as a \nmemcached\n node.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAt this time, both the Waffles server and destination node must have rsync and installed.",

            "text": "Modules\n\n\nAt this time, Waffles has no concept of \"modules\" or \"plug-ins\". This is intentional.\n\n\nAll resources are currently being bundled into \n/lib\n. This is because the resource files are so small, it's not expensive (in terms of disk space or bandwidth transfer) to have one large bundle of resources. This also means that there might be some disagreement on the best way a resource is implemented.

In particular, Percona MySQL.\n\n\nSteps\n\n\nData\n\n\nThere will only be one data item: the MySQL root password. This example will store the password in plain text -- note that a best practice would be to install it either in an encrypted repository, an encrypted string, or something along those lines.\n\n\n$ cat site/data/mysql.sh\ndata_mysql_root_password=\npassword\n\n\n\n\n\nProfiles\n\n\nWe'll use two profile scripts for the MySQL server: the first will configure the Percona repo and the second will install and configure MySQL itself.\n\n\nFirst, make the directory structure\n\n\n$ mkdir -p site/profiles/mysql/scripts\n\n\n\n\nNext, make the repo profile script, located at \nsite/profiles/mysql/scripts/percona_repo.sh\n:\n\n\nstdlib.title \nmysql/percona/repo\n\n\nsource /etc/lsb-release\n\nstdlib.apt_key --name percona --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --key 1C4CBDCDCD2EFD2A\nstdlib.apt_source --name percona --uri http://repo.percona.com/apt --distribution $DISTRIB_CODENAME --component main --include_src true\n\n\n\n\nNext, make the MySQL profile script, located at \nsites/profilfes/mysql/scripts/percona_server.sh\n:\n\n\nstdlib.title \nmysql/percona/server\n\n\nhostname=$(hostname | sed -e 's/_/\\\\\\_/g')\n\nstdlib.apt --package percona-server-server-5.6\n\nmysql.user --user root --host localhost --password password\nmysql.mycnf --filename \n/root/.my.cnf\n --user root --password password\n\nmysql.user --state absent --user root --host 127.0.0.1 --password \n\nmysql.user --state absent --user root --host ::1 --password \n\nmysql.user --state absent --user \n --host localhost --password \n\nmysql.user --state absent --user root --host $hostname --password \n\nmysql.user --state absent --user \n --host $hostname --password \n\n\nmysql.database --state absent --name test\n\nstdlib.ini --file /etc/mysql/my.cnf --section mysqld --option bind-address --value 0.0.0.0\n\nif [[ $stdlib_state_change == true ]]; then\n  /etc/init.d/mysql restart\nfi\n\n\n\n\nThis script is rather simple in concept. Some notes about it:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nhostname\n variable is doing some shell escaping for MySQL commands.\n\n\nA \nroot@localhost\n user is being configured with the password set in the data file.\n\n\nMySQL installs several other default \nroot\n and \"blank\" users. We want to ensure these users are removed.\n\n\nWe also want to ensure that the \ntest\n database is removed.\n\n\nMySQL listens on localhost by default.

If not, it is set to all other nodes in the cluster. Once the cluster has been bootstrapped, you should remove the \nif\n conditional and only leave the \nelse\n portion.\n\n\nThe special variable \n$stdlib_state_change\n will be \ntrue\n if any changes were made at all in the file. If they were, we want to restart the MySQL service.

Create \nsite/profiles/common/scripts/packages.sh\n with the following contents:\n\n\nstdlib.apt --package wget\nstdlib.apt --package software-properties-common\n\n\n\n\nConsul\n\n\nWe'll use two profile scripts for the Consul cluster: the first will install Consul and the second will set up the Consul cluster.\n\n\nFirst, make the directory structure\n\n\n$ mkdir -p site/profiles/consul/scripts\n\n\n\n\nNext, make the repo profile script, located at \nsite/profiles/consul/scripts/install.sh\n:\n\n\nstdlib.title \nprofiles/consul/install\n\n\nstdlib.apt --package unzip\n\nstdlib.useradd --user consul --homedir /var/lib/consul --createhome true\nstdlib.directory --name /etc/consul.d --owner consul --group consul\n\nif [[ ! -f /usr/local/bin/consul ]]; then\n  stdlib.mute pushd /tmp\n  stdlib.capture_error wget https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/consul/${data_consul_version}_linux_amd64.zip\n  stdlib.capture_error unzip ${data_consul_version}_linux_amd64.zip\n  stdlib.capture_error mv consul /usr/local/bin\n  stdlib.mute popd\nfi\n\n\n\n\nThis install script is rather simple. It's doing the following:\n\n\n\n\nInstalls the \nunzip\n package\n\n\nCreates a \nconsul\n system user with a homedir of \n/var/lib/consul\n\n\nDownloads the Consul binary of the version we specified in the data\n\n\nUnzips it and installs it to \n/usr/local/bin\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote: the way this script determines if Consul is installed is by the presence of the \n/usr/local/bin/consul\n file. If this method is too simplistic for you, feel free to package Consul into a \ndeb\n or \nrpm\n package.\n\n\nNext, make the Consul server script, located at \nsites/profiles/consul/scripts/server.sh\n:\n\n\nstdlib.title \nprofiles/consul/server\n\n\nstdlib.file --name /etc/init/consul.conf --source \n$WAFFLES_SITE_DIR/profiles/consul/files/consul.conf\n\n\nfor key in \n${!data_consul_config[@]}\n; do\n  augeas.json_dict --file /etc/consul.d/config.json --path / --key \n$key\n --value \n${data_consul_config[$key]}\n\ndone\n\nstdlib.upstart --name consul --state running\n\nhostname=$(hostname)\nif [[ $hostname == $data_consul_bootstrap_node ]]; then\n  sleep 10\n  for i in \n${data_consul_nodes[@]}\n; do\n    if [[ $hostname != $i ]]; then\n      /usr/local/bin/consul join $i\n    fi\n  done\nfi\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some notes on the above:\n\n\n\n\nstdlib.file\n is able to copy a static file from \nsite/profiles/consul/files\n. It is \nhighly\n recommended to bundle your static files into the profile that they are being called from. This ensures that they get copied to the remote node during remote deployment. Alternatively, while there are not yet resources for commands such as \nscp\n or \nwget\n, you could use them similarly to how the Consul zip file was downloaded.\n\n\naugeas.json_dict\n is an Augeas-based resource that allows JSON files to be built on the command-line. In order to use Augeas, it must be installed. See the next section.\n\n\nstdlib.upstart\n ensures that the Consul service is running.\n\n\nFinally, the \nfor\n loop will run if the node is the bootstrap node. It'll loop through all other existing nodes and join them. The existing nodes must be up and running first, which is why the bootstrap node was set to the last node in the cluster.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, create \nsite/profiles/consul/files/consul.conf\n with the following content:\n\n\ndescription \nConsul agent\n\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nrespawn\n\nscript\n  if [ -f \n/etc/default/consul\n ]; then\n    # Gives us the CONSUL_FLAGS variable\n    . /etc/default/consul\n  fi\n\n  # Make sure to use all our CPUs, because Consul can block a scheduler thread\n  export GOMAXPROCS=`nproc`\n\n  exec /usr/local/bin/consul agent \\\n    -config-dir=\n/etc/consul.d\n \\\n    ${CONSUL_FLAGS} \\\n    \n/var/log/consul.log 2\n1\nend script\n\n\n\n\nAugeas\n\n\nTo install Augeas, create \nsite/profiles/augeas/scripts/install_apt.sh\n with the following content:\n\n\nstdlib.title \nprofiles/augeas/install_apt\n\n\nstdlib.apt_ppa --ppa raphink/augeas\nstdlib.apt --package augeas-tools --version latest\n\n\n\n\nRoles\n\n\nFinally, combine the above Data and Profiles to build the role, located at \nsite/roles/consul.sh\n:\n\n\nstdlib.enable_augeas\n\nstdlib.data consul\n\nstdlib.profile common/packages\nstdlib.profile augeas/install_apt\nstdlib.profile consul/install\nstdlib.profile consul/server\n\n\n\n\nThe \nstdlib.enable_augeas\n function is a special function that will source all of the relevant Augeas functions and resources located under \nlib\n.\n\n\nThe rest of the role should be self-explanatory.\n\n\nRun\n\n\nYou should now run this against 3 servers, containers, or virtual machines of your choice.\n\n\nComments and Conclusion\n\n\nThe above example describes a simple way of deploying a Consul cluster using Waffles.

If yours doesn't, use \ncloud-init\n or a similar system to pre-install it.\n\n\nThe virtual machine that Terraform creates is accessible via IPv6. If yours isn't, either attach a Floating or Elastic IP or use the fixed IP somehow.\n\n\nThe SSH key being used is \n/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n. This is because Waffles does not support non-default SSH keys yet.\n\n\nSSH access is allowed through the security group.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThis guide showed one way of using Waffles with Terraform. Both systems are extremely flexible and complement each other well, so there may be other ways of achieving the same result.\n\n\nFor example, you could use Terraform's \nfile\n provisioner to copy the entire \n~/.waffles\n directory to the remote virtual machine. The benefit of using Waffles's built-in push is that only the files which the role requires are copied over.",

By swapping out any of the components (even Waffles), you should be able to achieve the same results. In this way, this guide can serve as a general-purpose document for deploying cloud services.\n\n\nThis document will use the following combination of tools and services:\n\n\n\n\nCloud Environment: OpenStack, specifically with IPv6 support and a single public subnet\n\n\nCloud Environment: Amazon AWS, specifically for Route53 DNSaaS\n\n\nCloud Infrastructure Deployment: Terraform\n\n\nConfiguration Management: Waffles\n\n\nOperating System: Ubuntu 14.04\n\n\n\n\nFirst Steps\n\n\nCloud Access\n\n\nMake sure you have proper access to the required cloud environments. For this guide, OpenStack and AWS will be used. Make note of the credentials needed to access these environments.\n\n\nAmazon's Route53 service will be used for DNSaaS. Make sure you have delegated a domain or subdomain to Route53.\n\n\nInstall Waffles\n\n\nTo begin, first install Waffles to the \n/etc/waffles\n directory:\n\n\n$ cd /etc\n$ sudo git clone https://github.com/jtopjian/waffles\n\n\n\n\nInfrastructure Code Directory\n\n\nNext, create a directory that will be used to hold the infrastructure code:\n\n\n$ cd\n$ mkdir infrastructure\n$ cd infrastructure\n\n\n\n\nThis directory will have several subdirectories. The first is a \nkeys\n directory to hold SSH keys:\n\n\n$ mkdir keys\n$ cd keys\n$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -N '' -f infra\n$ cd ..\n\n\n\n\nThe next directory is \nrc\n, which will hold the credentials to the cloud services being used:\n\n\n$ mkdir rc\n$ cd rc\n$ touch openstack\n$ touch aws\n$ cd ..\n\n\n\n\nThe third directory is for Waffles. Though Waffles was installed in \n/etc/waffles\n, this directory will be used to hold the site-specific configuration. By doing this, you can create a whole other infrastructure directory (maybe \ninfrastructure2\n, for a lack of a creative name) that will contain a different set of infrastructure.\n\n\n$ mkdir -p waffles/{data,profiles,roles}\n\n\n\n\nThe fourth directory is for Terraform. This will hold all Terraform configurations:\n\n\n$ mkdir terraform\n\n\n\n\nInfrastructure Makefile\n\n\nThis guide will use a \nMakefile\n to assist with common tasks. Create a file called \nMakefile\n located in the \ninfrastructure\n directory. We'll add tasks to the \nMakefile\n as this guide goes on, but for now, start with:\n\n\nWSD = waffles\n\ntplan:\n  @. cd terraform/$(ROLE) \n terraform plan\n\ntapply:\n  @. cd terraform/$(ROLE) \n terraform apply\n\ntdestroy:\n  @. cd terraform/$(ROLE) \n terraform destroy\n\n.PHONY: waffles\nwaffles:\n  WAFFLES_SITE_DIR=$(WSD) /etc/waffles/waffles.sh -s $(NODE) -k keys/infra -r $(ROLE)\n\n\n\n\nNode Inventory\n\n\nFinally, create a blank file called \nnodes\n. This will be used to hold an inventory of the deployed nodes:\n\n\n$ touch nodes\n\n\n\n\nFoundational Components\n\n\nBefore we start deploying actual services, some foundational pieces need to be created, specifically an OpenStack Security Group and SSH Key Pair.\n\n\nCreate the directory \ninfrastructure/terraform/support\n and in that directory, create the file \nmain.tf\n with the following contents:\n\n\nresource \nopenstack_compute_keypair_v2\n \nsupport\n {\n  name = \ninfra\n\n  public_key = \n${file(\n~/infrastructure/keys/infra.pub\n)}\n\n}\n\nresource \nopenstack_compute_secgroup_v2\n \nsupport\n {\n  name = \nAllowAll\n\n  description = \nGroup to allow all traffic\n\n\n  rule {\n    ip_protocol = \ntcp\n\n    from_port = 1\n    to_port = 65535\n    cidr = \n0.0.0.0/0\n\n  }\n\n  rule {\n    ip_protocol = \nudp\n\n    from_port = 1\n    to_port = 65535\n    cidr = \n0.0.0.0/0\n\n  }\n\n  rule {\n    ip_protocol = \nicmp\n\n    from_port = -1\n    to_port = -1\n    cidr = \n0.0.0.0/0\n\n  }\n\n  rule {\n    ip_protocol = \ntcp\n\n    from_port = 1\n    to_port = 65535\n    cidr = \n::/0\n\n  }\n  rule {\n    ip_protocol = \nudp\n\n    from_port = 1\n    to_port = 65535\n    cidr = \n::/0\n\n  }\n\n  rule {\n    ip_protocol = \nicmp\n\n    from_port = -1\n    to_port = -1\n    cidr = \n::/0\n\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nNext, source the \nrc/openstack\n file and deploy the infrastructure:\n\n\n$ source rc/openstack\n$ make tplan ROLE=support\n$ make tapply ROLE=support\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, Terraform has deployed the Security Group and Key Pair.\n\n\nCommon Waffles Settings\n\n\nWhen configuring each individual node, a lot of settings will be common amongst all of them. These settings can be added to a single \"common\" data file called \ninfrastructure/waffles/data/common.sh\n:\n\n\n# Declare global variables\ndeclare -ag data_users=()\ndeclare -Ag data_user_info=()\ndeclare -ag data_services=()\ndeclare -Ag data_service_info=()\n\n# Standard node information\ndeclare -Ag data_node_info=()\ndata_node_info[domain]=\nexample.com\n\ndata_node_info[hostname]=$(hostname)\ndata_node_info[ip]=$(ip addr show dev eth0 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1 | head -1)\ndata_node_info[ip6]=$(ip addr show dev eth0 | grep inet6 | awk '{print $2}' | head -1 | cut -d/ -f1)\ndata_node_info[nproc]=$(nproc)\n\n# Packages to be installed on all nodes\ndeclare -ag data_packages=()\nstdlib.array_push data_packages wget\nstdlib.array_push data_packages curl\nstdlib.array_push data_packages tmux\nstdlib.array_push data_packages vim\nstdlib.array_push data_packages iptables\n\n# ACNG server\ndata_acng_server=\nacng.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above script is simply building some hashes and arrays to store common settings. This includes common packages, the node's hostname and domain name, its IPv4 and IPv6 address, and the \napt-cacher-ng\n server it should use.\n\n\nNext, we'll create a \"common\" profile. This profile will contain scripts that are applicable to any type of node in the environment. First, create the directory structure \ninfrastructure/waffles/profiles/common/scripts\n. And then create the following scripts under it:\n\n\nacng.sh\n\n\nstdlib.title \ncommon/acng\n\n\nstdlib.file --name /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01acng --content \nAcquire::http { Proxy \\\nhttp://$data_acng_server:3142\\\n; };\n\n\n\n\n\npackages.sh\n\n\nstdlib.title \ncommon/packages\n\n\nfor pkg in \n${data_packages[@]}\n; do\n  stdlib.split $pkg '='\n  stdlib.apt --state present --package \n${__split[0]}\n --version \n${__split[1]}\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\nsudo.sh\n\n\nstdlib.title \ncommon/sudo\n\n\nstdlib.file_line --name \nsudoers.d/00-common/always_set_home\n --file /etc/sudoers.d/00-common --line \nDefaults always_set_home\n\n\n\n\n\nupdates.sh\n\n\nstdlib.title \ncommon/updates\n\n\nread -r -d '' _security_updates \nEOF\nAPT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \n1\n;\nAPT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \n1\n;\nEOF\nstdlib.file --name /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades --content \n$_security_updates\n\n\n\n\n\nusers.sh\n\n\nstdlib.title \ncommon/users\n\n\nfor user in \n${data_users[@]}\n; do\n  _state=\n${data_user_info[$user|state]:-present}\n\n  _username=\n${data_user_info[$user|name]:-present}\n\n  _homedir=\n${data_user_info[$user|homedir]:-\n}\n\n  _uid=\n${data_user_info[$user|uid]:-\n}\n\n  _gid=\n${data_user_info[$user|gid]:-\n}\n\n  _comment=\n${data_user_info[$user|comment]:-\n}\n\n  _shell=\n${data_user_info[$user|shell]:-\n}\n\n  _passwd=\n${data_user_info[$user|password]:-\n}\n\n  _create_home=\n${data_user_info[$user|create_home]:-\ntrue\n}\n\n  _create_group=\n${data_user_info[$user|create_group]:-\ntrue\n}\n\n  _groups=\n${data_user_info[$user|groups]:-\n}\n\n  _sudo=\n${data_user_info[$user|sudo]:-\n}\n\n  _system=\n${data_user_info[$user|system]:-\n}\n\n\n  if [[ $_create_group == \ntrue\n ]]; then\n    stdlib.groupadd --state $_state --group \n$_username\n --gid \n$_gid\n\n  fi\n\n  stdlib.useradd --state $_state --user \n$_username\n --uid \n$_uid\n --gid \n$_gid\n --comment \n$_comment\n --homedir \n$_homedir\n --shell \n$_shell\n --passwd \n$_passwd\n --groups \n$_groups\n --createhome \n$_createhome\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\nAugeas\n\n\nAlong with the Waffles Common profile, create a profile that will install and configure Augeas.  Augeas is used to manipulate configuration files that have more difficult styles and formats.\n\n\nWaffles includes a set of Augeas-based resources, but Waffles does not handle the actual installation and configuration of Augeas.\n\n\nCreate the \ninfrastructure/waffles/profiles/augeas/scripts\n directory and the following scripts:\n\n\napt_install.sh\n\n\nstdlib.title \naugeas/apt_install\n\n\nstdlib.apt_key --name augeas --key AE498453 --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com\nstdlib.apt_source --name augeas --uri http://ppa.launchpad.net/raphink/augeas/ubuntu --distribution trusty --component main\nstdlib.apt --package augeas-tools --version latest\n\n\n\n\nupdate_lenses.sh\n\n\nstdlib.title \naugeas/update_lenses\n\n\nstdlib.git --state latest --name /usr/src/augeas --source https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas\n\nif [[ $stdlib_resource_change == \ntrue\n ]]; then\n  stdlib.info \nUpdating lenses\n\n  stdlib.capture_error cp \n/usr/src/augeas/lenses/*.aug\n /usr/share/augeas/lenses/dist/\nfi\n\n\n\n\nFinal Base Directory Structure\n\n\nAt this point, the infrastructure directory should look like this:\n\n\ninfrastructure\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 keys\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 infra\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 infra.pub\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Makefile\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 nodes\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 rc\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 aws\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 openstack\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 terraform\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 support\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.tf\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 waffles\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 data\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 common.sh\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 profiles\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 augeas\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 apt_install.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 update_lenses.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 common\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0         \u251c\u2500\u2500 acng.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0         \u251c\u2500\u2500 packages.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0         \u251c\u2500\u2500 sudo.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0         \u251c\u2500\u2500 updates.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0         \u2514\u2500\u2500 users.sh\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 roles\n\n\n\n\nYou can also reference \nthis\n Git repository for a snapshot of how everything should look at this point.",

Since this service is so core to the infrastructure, it will be the first service deployed.\n\n\nThis guide will use Consul for this service. Alternatives could be Etcd in combination with Nagios or Sensu.\n\n\nTerraform\n\n\nLet's begin by creating the Terraform structure. First, create the required directories:\n\n\n$ mkdir -p terraform/consul/scripts\n\n\n\n\nNext, create a small bootstrap script for the Consul nodes that will be launched. Save this script as \nterraform/consul/scripts/bootstrap.sh\n:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash                                    \n\ncp /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys /root/.ssh\n\n\n\n\nThis is just a quick hack to allow us to log into the nodes as the \nroot\n user.\n\n\nNext, create the \nterraform/consul/main.tf\n file:\n\n\nvariable \ncount\n {\n  default = 3\n}\n\nresource \nopenstack_compute_servergroup_v2\n \nconsul\n {\n  name = \nconsul\n\n  policies = [\nanti-affinity\n]\n}\n\nresource \nopenstack_compute_instance_v2\n \nconsul\n {\n  count = \n${var.count}\n\n  name = \n${format(\nconsul-%02d\n, count.index+1)}\n\n  image_name = \nUbuntu 14.04\n\n  flavor_name = \nm1.small\n\n  key_pair = \ninfra\n\n  security_groups = [\nAllowAll\n]\n  config_drive = true\n  user_data = \n${file(\nscripts/bootstrap.sh\n)}\n\n  scheduler_hints {\n    group = \n${openstack_compute_servergroup_v2.consul.id}\n\n  }\n\n  provisioner \nlocal-exec\n {\n    command = \nsed -i -e '/${self.name}/d' ~/infrastructure/nodes \n echo ${self.name} ${self.access_ip_v6} consul \n ~/infrastructure/nodes\n\n  }\n}\n\nresource \naws_route53_record\n \nconsul-v6\n {\n  zone_id = \nREPLACEME\n\n  name = \nconsul.example.com\n\n  type = \nAAAA\n\n  ttl = \n60\n\n  records = [\n${replace(openstack_compute_instance_v2.consul.*.access_ip_v6, \n/[\\[\\]]/\n, \n)}\n]\n}\n\nresource \naws_route53_record\n \nconsul-txt\n {\n  zone_id = \nREPLACEME\n\n  name = \nconsul.example.com\n\n  type = \nTXT\n\n  ttl = \n60\n\n  records = [\n${formatlist(\n%s.example.com\n, openstack_compute_instance_v2.consul.*.name)}\n]\n}\n\nresource \naws_route53_record\n \nconsul-individual\n {\n  count = \n${var.count}\n\n\n  zone_id = \nREPLACEME\n\n  name = \n${format(\nconsul-%02d.example.com\n, count.index+1)}\n\n  type = \nAAAA\n\n  ttl = \n60\n\n  records = [\n${replace(element(openstack_compute_instance_v2.consul.*.access_ip_v6, count.index), \n/[\\[\\]]/\n, \n)}\n]\n}\n\n\nresource \nnull_resource\n \nconsul\n {\n  count = \n${var.count}\n\n\n  provisioner \nlocal-exec\n {\n    command = \nsleep 10 \n cd ~/infrastructure \n make waffles NODE=${element(aws_route53_record.consul-individual.*.name, count.index)} KEY=keys/infra ROLE=consul\n\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThere's a lot going on here, so let's go over each component. Some of these components will become common to see as they'll be re-used many times in future Terraform configurations.\n\n\nCount\n\n\nvariable \ncount\n {\n  default = 3\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis determines how many nodes will make up the Consul cluster. By default, this configuration will create three, however, you can choose a larger number when Terraform prompts you.\n\n\nServer Group\n\n\nresource \nopenstack_compute_servergroup_v2\n \nconsul\n {\n  name = \nconsul\n\n  policies = [\nanti-affinity\n]\n}\n\n\n\n\nA \"Server Group\" is an OpenStack-specific feature that allows instances (virtual machines / nodes) to have a common policy applied to them. In this case, an \"anti-affinity\" policy is applied. This ensures that each Consul node is hosted on a different Compute Node. This way, if there's an underlying hardware failure on one of the Compute Nodes in the OpenStack cloud, the entire Consul cluster will not be affected.\n\n\nInstance\n\n\nresource \nopenstack_compute_instance_v2\n \nconsul\n {\n  count = \n${var.count}\n\n  name = \n${format(\nconsul-%02d\n, count.index+1)}\n\n  image_name = \nUbuntu 14.04\n\n  flavor_name = \nm1.small\n\n  key_pair = \ninfra\n\n  security_groups = [\nAllowAll\n]\n  config_drive = true\n  user_data = \n${file(\nscripts/bootstrap.sh\n)}\n\n  scheduler_hints {\n    group = \n${openstack_compute_servergroup_v2.consul.id}\n\n  }\n\n  provisioner \nlocal-exec\n {\n    command = \nsed -i -e '/${self.name}/d' ~/infrastructure/nodes \n echo ${self.name} ${self.access_ip_v6} consul \n ~/infrastructure/nodes\n\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Instance\" resource is the heart of this configuration. Some notes:\n\n\n\n\nNotice that there's only one \"Instance\" defined, but because \ncount\n is set to the \"count\" variable, three (by default) will be created.\n\n\nThe name of each instance will take the format \nconsul-NN\n where \nNN\n is the count in sequence.\n\n\nThe \nuser_data\n parameter will cause the \nscripts/bootstrap.sh\n script to run when the instance launches.\n\n\nscheduler_hints\n places the instance in the Server Group previously created.\n\n\n\n\nAlso note the \nlocal-exec\n provisioner. This runs a simple shell command that adds the following pieces of information to \ninfrastructure/nodes\n:\n  * name\n  * IPv6 Address\n  * Role\n\n\nDNS Records\n\n\nresource \naws_route53_record\n \nconsul-v6\n {\n  zone_id = \nREPLACEME\n\n  name = \nconsul.example.com\n\n  type = \nAAAA\n\n  ttl = \n60\n\n  records = [\n${replace(openstack_compute_instance_v2.consul.*.access_ip_v6, \n/[\\[\\]]/\n, \n)}\n]\n}\n\nresource \naws_route53_record\n \nconsul-txt\n {\n  zone_id = \nREPLACEME\n\n  name = \nconsul.example.com\n\n  type = \nTXT\n\n  ttl = \n60\n\n  records = [\n${formatlist(\n%s.example.com\n, openstack_compute_instance_v2.consul.*.name)}\n]\n}\n\nresource \naws_route53_record\n \nconsul-individual\n {\n  count = \n${var.count}\n\n\n  zone_id = \nREPLACEME\n\n  name = \n${format(\nconsul-%02d.example.com\n, count.index+1)}\n\n  type = \nAAAA\n\n  ttl = \n60\n\n  records = [\n${replace(element(openstack_compute_instance_v2.consul.*.access_ip_v6, count.index), \n/[\\[\\]]/\n, \n)}\n]\n}\n\n\n\n\nThese three resources create a series of DNS records on Amazon Route53. The first record creates an \nAAAA\n record called \nconsul.example.com\n. This record contains the IPv6 address of each created Consul node. Since this record holds more than one IP address, Route53 will return each address in a round-robin fashion.\n\n\nThe second DNS record creates a \nTXT\n record. This record acts as a piece of scratch paper in the DNS system. It holds the hostnames of each created Consul node and will help with bootstrapping Consul.\n\n\nThe third DNS record creates individual \nAAAA\n records for each of the Consul nodes.\n\n\nProvisioner\n\n\nresource \nnull_resource\n \nconsul\n {\n  count = \n${var.count}\n\n\n  provisioner \nlocal-exec\n {\n    command = \nsleep 10 \n cd ~/infrastructure \n make waffles NODE=${element(aws_route53_record.consul-individual.*.name, count.index)} KEY=keys/infra ROLE=consul\n\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe final resource is a \"Null\" resource. This is a bit of a hack in Terraform to get around the fact that \"Provisioners\" must be attached to a resource of some type. It's not possible to simply have a \"Provisioning\" step.\n\n\nThis resource will run the commands in the \ncommand\n parameter for each of the created Consul nodes. An example of the rendered command is:\n\n\nsleep 10\nmake waffles NODE=consul-01.example.com KEY=keys/infra ROLE=consul\n\n\n\n\nmake\n corresponds to the \nMakefile\n created in the Intro part of this guide. \nmake waffles\n is an actual task that was added to the \nMakefile\n.\n\n\nOf course, the Provisioner could have just gone in the Instance resource, but we want \nall\n resources to be created before any provisioning begins to take place. In this specific case, it's because we want the DNS records to be populated before Consul is built.\n\n\nWith all of this in place, let's move on to the Waffles side:\n\n\nWaffles\n\n\nData\n\n\nTo begin, create a Waffles \ndata\n file to hold the Consul configuration data. This file will be \nwaffles/data/consul.sh\n:\n\n\nconsul.sh\n\n\n# Tell Waffles about the user and service\nstdlib.array_push data_users \nconsul\n\nstdlib.array_push data_services \nconsul\n\n\n# Consul Version\ndata_consul_version=\n0.5.2\n\ndata_consul_template_version=\n0.10.0\n\n\n# Consul Tokens and Keys\ndata_consul_encrypt_key=\nCHANGEME\n\ndata_consul_cluster_name=\nconsul.example.com\n\n\n# Describe the user\n# This user is added by common/users\ndata_user_info[consul|name]=\nconsul\n\ndata_user_info[consul|uid]=\n900\n\ndata_user_info[consul|gid]=\n900\n\ndata_user_info[consul|homedir]=\n/var/lib/consul\n\n\n# Any extra generic packages\n# This package is installed by common/packages\nstdlib.array_push data_packages unzip\n\n# Consul config\ndeclare -Ag data_consul_server_config=(\n  [server]=\ntrue\n\n  [advertise_addr]=\n${data_node_info[ip6]}\n\n  [client_addr]=\n127.0.0.1\n\n  [bind_addr]=\n0.0.0.0\n\n  [bootstrap_expect]=\n3\n\n  [datacenter]=\nhonolulu\n\n  [data_dir]=\n/var/lib/consul\n\n  [encrypt]=\n${data_consul_encrypt_key}\n\n  [enable_syslog]=\ntrue\n\n  [log_level]=\nINFO\n\n  [rejoin_after_leave]=\ntrue\n\n  [retry_interval]=\n30s\n\n  [ui_dir]=\n/opt/consul-web/dist\n\n)\n\ndeclare -Ag data_consul_client_config=(\n  [advertise_addr]=\n${data_node_info[ip6]}\n\n  [client_addr]=\n127.0.0.1\n\n  [datacenter]=\nhonolulu\n\n  [data_dir]=\n/var/lib/consul\n\n  [encrypt]=\n${data_consul_encrypt_key}\n\n  [enable_syslog]=\ntrue\n\n  [log_level]=\nINFO\n\n  [rejoin_after_leave]=\ntrue\n\n  [retry_interval]=\n30s\n\n)\n\ndeclare -Ag data_consul_template_config=(\n  [global|consul]=\nlocalhost:8500\n\n  [global|retry]=\n10s\n\n  [global|max_stale]=\n10m\n\n  [global|log_level]=\nINFO\n\n  [syslog|enabled]=\ntrue\n\n  [syslog|facility]=\nLOCAL5\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nProfile\n\n\nNext, create the Consul profile.

For brevity, you can find these scripts in the Git repo linked at the end of this document.\n\n\nRole\n\n\nWith the Consul Data and Profile in place, it's time to build the role. Create the file \nwaffles/roles/consul.sh\n with the following contents:\n\n\nstdlib.enable_augeas\nstdlib.enable_consul\n\nstdlib.data common\nstdlib.data consul\n\nstdlib.profile common/acng\nstdlib.profile common/packages\nstdlib.profile common/users\nstdlib.profile common/updates\nstdlib.profile common/sudo\n\nstdlib.profile augeas/apt_install\nstdlib.profile augeas/update_lenses\n\nstdlib.profile consul/server\nstdlib.profile consul/template\nstdlib.profile consul/template_hosts\n\n\n\n\nThe \nstdlib.enable_augeas\n and \nstdlib.enable_consul\n commands are built-in to Waffles. They enable augeas and consul-specific functions and resources. See the Waffles documentation for more information.\n\n\nThe rest of the role should be self-explanatory: the \ncommon\n and \nconsul\n data files are being read, then the \ncommon\n, \naugeas\n and \nconsul\n profiles. Everything combined makes up a unique \"Consul\" role.\n\n\nDeploying\n\n\nTo deploy the cluster, do the following:\n\n\n$ make tplan ROLE=consul\n$ make tapply ROLE=consul\n\n\n\n\nIf everything was successful, you should have a running Consul cluster. You can verify this by doing:\n\n\n$ ssh -i keys/infra consul.example.com\n$ consul status\n\n\n\n\nConsul Key-Value Storage\n\n\nConsul was setup in a way that restricts access to the key-value store to only nodes running Consul. Terraform provides a \nconsul_keys\n resource that can store data from the Terraform configuration in Consul. Rather than installing Consul on your workstation, an alternative is to SSH into the Consul cluster and forward the port 8500. To do this, make a new task in the \nMakefile\n called \nctunnel\n:\n\n\nctunnel:                                                        \n  ssh -i keys/infra -L 8500:localhost:8500 consul.example.com\n\n\n\n\nNow run the task:\n\n\n$ make ctunnel\n\n\n\n\nYou should now have forwarded access to your Consul cluster.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThis part of the Infrastructure guide detailed how to deploy a Consul cluster. At this point, your directory structure should look like:\n\n\ninfrastructure\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 keys\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 infra\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 infra.pub\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Makefile\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 nodes\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 rc\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 aws\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 openstack\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 terraform\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 consul\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.tf\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 bootstrap.sh\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 support\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.tf\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 waffles\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 data\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 common.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 consul.sh\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 profiles\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 augeas\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 apt_install.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 update_lenses.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 common\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 acng.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 packages.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 sudo.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 updates.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 users.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 consul\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 files\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 consul.conf\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 consul-template.conf\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 hosts.ctmpl\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 purge_failed.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0         \u251c\u2500\u2500 client.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0         \u251c\u2500\u2500 server.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0         \u251c\u2500\u2500 template_hosts.sh\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0         \u2514\u2500\u2500 template.sh\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 roles\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 consul.sh\n\n\n\n\nYou can find the final scripts and structure \nhere\n.",

This header describes what the resource does, what parameters it takes, how to use it, and any comments. The comment header is very important as this is where the resource documentation is generated from.\n\n\nfunction resource.name\n\n\nThe next part of a resource is the first \"function\". This first function is named after the resource name. So any time you use a resource, you're actually just calling a Bash function.\n\n\nThe first thing done inside this function is to call a \"subtitle\" with \nstdlib.subtitle\n. Subtitles serve two purposes:\n\n\n\n\nThey set the name to be printed when running Waffles.\n\n\nThey reset an internal flag for changes made in the resource. This flag is called \nstdlib_resource_change\n. See the \"State Changes\" section for more details.\n\n\n\n\nNext, an \noptions\n variable is declared. It is important that this variable is declared in each resource. If not, then the resource will share variables with the last called resource. After the \noptions\n variable is declared, any parameters for the resource are declared. Finally, variables are checked via \nstdlib.options.parse_options\n. All logic related to \noptions\n can be found in \n$WAFFLES_DIR/lib/options.sh\n.\n\n\nAfter options, any local variables are defined.\n\n\nNext, any optional custom logic is defined. This usually includes local variables just for the resource or ensuring that correctly formatted parameters were given.\n\n\nNext, \nstdlib.resource.process\n is called.\n\n\nfunction stdlib.resource.process\n\n\nThis is a centralized function that was introduced to help reduce repeated code in all resources. It does the following:\n\n\n\n\nA catalog entry is made.\n\n\nstdlib.resource.read\n is called, which in turn calls \ncalling_resource.read\n.\n\n\nA comparison is made of the resource state versus the state that the resource should be in.\n\n\nDepending on the results of the above, \nstdlib.resource.x\n is called, which in turn calls \ncalling_resource.x\n.\n\n\n\n\nEach of the \nstdlib.resource.x\n functions do a few other things like determine if a resource change was made and how many changes were made throughout the entire run. In the future, these functions may also generate summary reports of the run.\n\n\nfunction resource.name.x\n\n\nThe rest of the resource is made up of four standard functions:\n\n\n\n\nfunction.name.read\n\n\nfunction.name.create\n\n\nfunction.name.update\n\n\nfunction.name.delete\n\n\n\n\nSome resources contain extra functions, but they always tie back into those standard four. Sometimes \nfunction.name.update\n just calls \ndelete\n and \ncreate\n.\n\n\nIf you create a resource that conforms to those four functions, it'll work just fine in Waffles.\n\n\nfunction resource.name.read\n\n\nThe \nread\n function determines the current state of the resource. For example, \nstdlib.apt.read\n determines if the package is installed, and if so, what version is installed.\n\n\nfunction resource.name.create\n\n\nThe \ncreate\n function does whatever is required to create the the resource. For example, \nstdlib.apt.create\n installs a package via \napt\n and \nstdlib.file_line.create\n adds a line to a given file either by \necho\n or \nsed\n.\n\n\nIt's important to try to stick with a core philosophy of Waffles: use standard nix utilities for the creation of resources.\n\n\nfunction resource.name.update\n\n\nIf the work required to update a resource is different than creating a resource, use the \nupdate\n function. However, if it's easier to simply delete the resource and recreate it, then do that instead of an update function. Just don't use that method as an excuse.\n\n\nfunction resource.name.delete\n\n\nThis function deletes the resource. For example, \nstdlib.apt.delete\n will actually remove the package.\n\n\nState Changes\n\n\nAfter you call a resource, you can check the status of the \nstdlib_resource_change\n flag. If it is true, then a change happened when you called the resource. For example:\n\n\nstdlib.apt --package sl --version latest\n\nif [[ $stdlib_resource_change == \ntrue\n ]]; then\n  stdlib.info \nPackage sl was installed or upgraded.\n\nfi\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to \nstdlib_resource_change\n is \nstdlib_state_change\n. \nstdlib_state_change\n works in the exact same way, but it is reset when a call to \nstdlib.title\n is made. You usually use \nstdlib.title\n at the beginning of Profiles.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nUse the Standard Library and Augeas resources as examples of how resources are built.",
